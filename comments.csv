dO2LWKpeyI8,2024 biden  the movie by oliver stone lol
dO2LWKpeyI8,They hate trump show much biden is tge real dirtbags
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Superb film, get the director&#39;s cut with Sam Waterston added back in."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Had to dislike video too many f_cking ads a_shole!
dO2LWKpeyI8,soundtrack written by john williams :o
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Forgot Martha MITCHELL  in this story, it appears"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Amazing actor. He doesn&#39;t even try to impersonate Nixon or sound just like him and yet you believe he really is Nixon.
dO2LWKpeyI8,first time i&#39;ve heard anthony hopkins doing american accent...it&#39;s refreshing 🥰
dO2LWKpeyI8,Anthony Hopkins the best actor of our time * 100% of his abilities to duplicate the character Hopkins saturate himself to become * There is no other actor that can portray that naturally *
dO2LWKpeyI8,Superb trailer
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Great movie, but like the movie, the trailer was a little too long."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Joe Biden has a little bit of Richard Nixon in him. <br><br>Nixon may have left a little bit of descendent taste, descendant message to Biden. <br><br>President Richard Nixon called on than Senator-elect Joe Biden December 19, 1972 to check on Biden family and congratulating Joe Biden for winning Delaware Senate seat. <br><br>Richard Nixon and Joe Biden both come from hardscrabble families."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"The only reason why watched Oliver Stone Nixion, because of Anthony Hopkins and Larry hangman."
dO2LWKpeyI8,The guy was a lousy crook.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Director&#39;s Cut version is the best, unfortunately Stone had to delete the Helms scene because helms made a Threat to sue Stone."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I visited President Nixon’s Presidential Library In 2008. It was a beautiful setting. In 1972 I was a McGovern supporter, but after visiting the library, I came away with new respect for President Nixon."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Wonder if a Trump film is in the works - many differences; yes Nixon ended the Vietnam war; overhauled many government agencies and created a few more like EPA and US Postal Service.  But Trump paralleled Nixon in meeting with North Korea&#39;s Kim Jong-Un like Nixon&#39;s meeting with Chinese PRC chairman Mao Zedong as no previous US President would consider.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Anthony Hopkins was way more scarier as Nixon than he was as Hannibal Lector.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"This, JFK, and Platoon = my fave Oliver Stone films."
dO2LWKpeyI8,i cant help but feel like if someone was to make a movie about trump as president it would be it would be way more dramatic and insane then this.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Nixon was the president of the United States. Of the United States. He was president of the United States. He was President. Of the United States. He was the president of the United States of America. Nixon was. Richard Nixon was the president of the United States of America.
dO2LWKpeyI8,When epic movies had epic trailers.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"God, it&#39;s so weird to think that this movie is technically a Disney film. And it was so controversial for the way it depicted Richard Nixon&#39;s life, that Walt Disney&#39;s daughter actually had to write a letter to The Nixon family, disapproving the movie."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I remember being in a mostly empty theater and seeing this <a href=""http://trailer.at/"">trailer.At</a> the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2LWKpeyI8&amp;t=4m14s"">4:14</a> mark,some guy across from me let out one of the biggest laughs I have ever heard in my life."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Still one of the best film trailers I’ve ever seen.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Love this movie ! Powers Boothe was great as Alexander Haig .
dO2LWKpeyI8,For Both Donald J Trump and Rodrigo Duterte Losing and Sacrificing Their Life  to World Spies Jerks Bastards Beauties......
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I love this film. A classic. Hopkins performance mesmerising. Simply one of the greatest political biopics of cinema history. Other viewers​ may disagree but Nixon is not simply portrayed as some kind of political bogeyman, there are variations of light and darkness here concerning Richard Nixon. As with any human being. That makes it a deep, thoughtful film. May I recommend Frost/Nixon as another excellent film."
dO2LWKpeyI8,This was one of Anthony Hopkins best performances.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I think Hopkins was a little miscast here. He never really gets the very characteristic voice patherns of Nixon, that deep growl."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Complete agreement with the summary of this videa
dO2LWKpeyI8,I don&#39;t believe that Pat Nixon ever raised her voice in her life.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Trump will get a movie like this xD
dO2LWKpeyI8,We all know Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor.  However his accent in this is TERRIBLE!!!  I hear too much of his British accent coming in and out.  I wish they would have used an American actor to play Nixon.
dO2LWKpeyI8,God bless Richard Nixon 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🐘🐘🐘🐘
dO2LWKpeyI8,Im glad that i have this movie On Dvd  .. amazing movie  ❗
dO2LWKpeyI8,i have been to Nixon museum   half of the visitors are from Mainland China.    Nixon was to us the Horatio  Alger of the late 1960&#39;s.
dO2LWKpeyI8,lol James Woods became his character in real life
dO2LWKpeyI8,"What a Trailer, they don&#39;t make them like that anymore."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I wonder what kind of job Al Pacino might have done, playing Nixon as a kind of Mob Boss, which is what he basically was. Imagine Nixon as Tony Montana ..There doesn&#39;t have to be an exact physical resemblance, and the hint of Hannibal Lecter in the portrayal works well, but imo it is impossible to suspend disbelief that we are watching Nixon on the screen instead of Anthony Hopkins. His performance is all in the VOICE and makeup. It&#39;s like watching 2 hours of bad screen test."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"OKAY, I&#39;m not normally a fan of Oliver Stone but this one just blew me away after watched it using boxxy software. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn&#39;t that how life seems to be at times as well?"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Why did they pick Anthony Hopkins to be Nixon, personly I think he doesn&#39;t look much like him at all."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Nixon was amazing. The elite wanted him out like JFK. He was a great American.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I&#39;m binge watching &quot;The Post&quot; (2018), &quot;All the President&#39;s Men&quot;<br>(1976) and &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995) at the moment.  A nostalgic trip down memory lane..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Nixon&#39;s worst mistake was to open China and give communism a gate for the 21st century. Other than that, leftists would be buried with old Soviet Union. The final speech is amazing! Great movie!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Do you really want this dick ?
dO2LWKpeyI8,Do you really want this dick?
dO2LWKpeyI8,That&#39;s one long trailer. But it looks like a good movie :-)
dO2LWKpeyI8,What a great performance<br> by Hopkins!!!!
dO2LWKpeyI8,I watch this every night. Love the last line in the trailer.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Stone&#39;s best film, I reckon. Brilliant."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Amazing trailer for one of my all time favorite movies!!!!
dO2LWKpeyI8,I don/t like Oliver&#39;s tone.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Every goddamn awesome john williams&#39;score reminds me to Star Wars
dO2LWKpeyI8,"&quot;When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are.&quot; That is a line you use to seal the deal with a trailer."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"JR Ewing at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2LWKpeyI8&amp;t=2m40s"">2:40</a>"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Ah, the days before movie trailers had to fade/in out between every transition."
dO2LWKpeyI8,I didn&#39;t know Niles Crane served on the Nixon Administration staff.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Hannibal Lecter?  Aw, give me a fuckin&#39; break, for god sakes."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I&#39;m sorry, i can&#39;t get past the casting of Anthony Hopkins- he looks and sounds NOTHING like Nixon."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Great movie and I consider it Oliver Stone&#39;s best.  But why is the trailer 4.5 minutes?
dO2LWKpeyI8,This guy is a true idiot. Ignoring him might be the best thing one can do...
dO2LWKpeyI8,"You pseudo-expert called Williams a &quot;plagiarist hack&quot;. That alone tells me that you have no clue what you&#39;re talking or writing about. You pretend to have a clue about whatever you think it is, but you actually don&#39;t know shit. And again: it has nothing to do with hearing music differently. It has something to do with having a taste in music or not. And you pal, are missing that taste. There&#39;s no accounting for taste, because you don&#39;t have any. That&#39;s why we should end this &quot;conversation&quot;..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"You seem to be unable to understand what I was writing you in my previous comment. Don&#39;t know what&#39;s so hard about that. Anyway, you&#39;re still wrong about what you wrote. Has nothing to do with hearing, but rather something with understanding. And you definitely didn&#39;t understand a bit..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"You neither have a good taste in music, nor do you have the clue what you&#39;re talking about in the first place. This track is called &quot;The 1960s: The Turbulent Years&quot; and is played when dramatic events during this period of time are shown in &quot;Nixon&quot;, e.g. the assassination of Martin Luther King, the war in Vietnam and so on. You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, idiot..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Dramatically inappropriate? It&#39;s an operatic score for an operatic film, and one of his most rousing works. It does wonders for the film.

Who is he plagiarising here? Support your libellous claims. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,Anthony Hopkins gives a superb performance as the sweaty unscrupulous Nixon.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Ironically, the bombing of Cambodia was actually the most serious of the charges and yet now is completely forgotten - presidents bomb without the country&#39;s approval as a matter of routine now."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"lol, indeed. at 1:28"
dO2LWKpeyI8,I think this one is better than JFK
dO2LWKpeyI8,Frank Langella couldn&#39;t shine Hopkins boots. The overacting in Frost Nixon is not the worse thing about the movie. It doesn&#39;t depict Nixon or the interview well at all. It&#39;s about like watching Oliver Stone&#39;s version of what happened.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"j&#39;espere qu&#39;il est aussi bien que JFK........je l&#39;ai en dvd mais pas encore vu......un casting de fou (hopkins, woods, boothe, hoskins, harris, walsh...)"
dO2LWKpeyI8,irs obama-gate
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I&#39;m a big fan of this film but I think it would have worked better without the flashbacks to Nixon&#39;s childhood or even the flashbacks from the Eisenhower era and the 1960 and 1962 elections. Most of the information you get from these segments is unnecessary and/or explored in dialogue that takes place elsewhere in the movie. Plus, it&#39;s impossible to make Hopkins look like the younger Nixon. I would have kept the focus mainly on Nixon&#39;s presidency and the events of Watergate. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,"The movie&#39;s a bit of a mess, but the cast is AMAZING!!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Could anybody explain to me why the movie involved little to no interaction with either of Nixons Vice-Presidents: Spiro Agnew or Gerald Ford. The movie makes it seem like they never interacted, Im sure neither had anything to do with Watergate but with Cabinet meetings, and advisor meetings something should have been thrown. Unless Stone couldn&#39;t find a good actor to play them. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,"what a great trailer
"
dO2LWKpeyI8,larry hagmans character never existed in real life 
dO2LWKpeyI8,Nixon- Real life macbeth
dO2LWKpeyI8,This is easily the best politico movie I&#39;ve ever seen.  It is high drama and an incredible tragedy.  
dO2LWKpeyI8,"hopkins was astonishing in this movie...brilliant biopic by oliver stone,one of his greatest along with jfk..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,That actor who played nixon was a clone to an nbc reporter during the 61&#39; debate.
dO2LWKpeyI8,WTF are you insane. The Doors was superb.  The Doors was a million zillion times better than this.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Yes, and the people of Cambodia miss him too.   :L   A**hole!!!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Hahahaha...Are you being sarcastic dude?  The trailer but me to sleep, nevermind 3hours and 10 minutes of the actual movie."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Awesome trailer.  Makes you want to rush out and see the movie right away.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Those were different times.  Cold war, Pre internet and internet trolling, Demonstrations meant something, Wall Street wasn&#39;t the megalithic beast it is today.  Every decade has immensity to it, and we decide where we fit into those decades.  A great adventure is underway."
dO2LWKpeyI8,I&#39;m not really an admirer of Stone. I mean The Doors was embarrasingly poor. However Nixon is a solid effort
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I agree that its a masterpiece and is Oliver stones best, and I mostly agree with you ( exept the fact that its the greatest movie of all time, I say Schindlers list is) I love how the film made Nixon look like a bad person but still made him very sympethetic, Hopkin achieves as Richard Nixon. found it to be kinda simular &quot;Shakespeares Juleas Ceaser&quot; and &quot;Citizen Cane"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Excellent movie!!!!!
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I love this movie. I grew up poor and became very successful (like Nixon). I understand Nixon. He loved America. Unlike Obama, Nixon really cared about America!!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I hate the film trailers, because somo of the pictures was removed later on the final movie"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen and Paul Sorvino have NEVER been BETTER in a movie -- period!!  :)"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Wow, long trailer. Anyway, Hannibal as Nixon? Who knew....."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Stone&#39;s movies are always 50/50. 50% accurate (brilliantly) and 50% fictional (brilliantly). This movie is OK, but Hopkins&#39; accent is to present. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Hopkins sure makes a fat, rotund Nixon."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Of all actors who played Nixon, Hopkins captured the essence of Nixon the best.

(and he&#39;s not even American...now THAT is an actor)"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Classic?   Are you kidding?
dO2LWKpeyI8,RIC YOUNG is best of MAO!!

lsmXhM4yfU0,I love how the trailer shows the murderer... smart.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"This is one of those movies that will remain with you it was done so well.
Unfortunately when it came out it was competing with some Box Office Sequels so it was overwhelmed and did well internationally and on rental at that time.
A FANTASTIC MOVIE AND A MUST SEE FOR THE SUSPENSE/THRILLER AND HORROR MOVIE FANS!!!

lsmXhM4yfU0,I loved it - especially the apartment! : )
lsmXhM4yfU0,"I agree with the killer from Se7en. All the preperation is scarier than anything. 

But Buffalo Bill from SotL is just as much of a copycat as &quot;Peter&quot;. since he copied Ed Gein. 
Or he&#39;s carracter is based on Gein anyway. 
Not just as disgusting tho. 

&quot;Peter&quot; at least chooses to copy the most infamous killers. ^_^"
lsmXhM4yfU0,"The concept is definitely one that seems to work and has been used in other movies as well.  This picture certainly wouldn&#39;t win any awards, but for some odd reason I enjoy watching it. Really enjoy this genre.  I can still see my mother so totally engrossed in it LOL.

Hmm...a remake might be a good idea.  I for one would love to see it."
lsmXhM4yfU0,TROLL MUCH.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"To each his own, I guess.

My mother was spellbound while watching this on TV.   I looked over and she was sitting on the edge of her seat during the entire second half.  Made me laugh because usually movies like this don&#39;t grab her in that way.  One of the reasons might have been that Weaver&#39;s character looked a lot like her when she was younger, so she associated with her.

Plus I&#39;m a fan of Holly Hunter.."

Scary shit."
lsmXhM4yfU0,Ms. Weaver is great in this movie. VERY thrilling. It got me into &#39;Murder By Numbers&#39; by The Police.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"The music used in this trailer is from &#39;The Pelican Brief&#39;, another excellent thriller."
lsmXhM4yfU0,Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) FTW!!!
lsmXhM4yfU0,"Add more tags! It&#39;s hard to find this trailer! By the way, very nice quality."

lsmXhM4yfU0,any more great thriller movie like this one?
lsmXhM4yfU0,This is kind of like silence of the lambs.  From watching the movie you would think that the guy in the trailer is the villian of the movie.  Same for Hannibal Lecter in silence of the lambs.
lsmXhM4yfU0,one of the best plots ever
lsmXhM4yfU0,I was joking. Relax. Take a deep breath. I&#39;ve seen the movie a thousand times. Saludos.
lsmXhM4yfU0,am telling the movie because i feel like it? do you have a problem with that? cause i hope you don´t. i don´t post comments in youtube to start a fight.
lsmXhM4yfU0,Harry Connick Jr is great as a serial killer.
lsmXhM4yfU0,Why are you telling the movie?
lsmXhM4yfU0,one of my all time favorite and a classic!!! love it!!
lsmXhM4yfU0,I watched this when I was about 10 years old and since then I&#39;ve felt uneasy whenever I went to one of those toilet booth-thingies that are open from the top.
toH1vzAmDBI,This is a perfect representation of what movie trailer should be like. Amazing visuals.
toH1vzAmDBI,"I know your comment&#39;s 2 years old, but if you&#39;re still wondering, the song is &quot;L&#39;Anniversaire d&#39;Irvin&quot; from this movie&#39;s soundtrack."
toH1vzAmDBI,"I&#39;m pretty sure the clip of the clone putting the lid over the camera is an alternate take from the scene in the actual film, which is kind of neat.
Come to think of it, I don&#39;t remember that scene of the scientist seeing the kids through the periscope. I gotta wonder how much was cut from the final version."
toH1vzAmDBI,Bioshock
toH1vzAmDBI," This movie is so old it should be public domain by now.  I owned this on magnetic tape, for heaven&#39;s sake.  Sony Pcitures are a bunch of cheapos for not letting you view it in full. Who would buy something so old that you can rent for next to nothing?"

mQf3Ngg2cks,Gong Li has been one of my fave actresses. She&#39;s always on point
mQf3Ngg2cks,I&#39;m just starving for a box set of Zhang Yimou&#39;s earlier films.. where are they????
mQf3Ngg2cks,"I had already thought Gong Li was among the very best actors on the world, and so beautiful. Her beauty in this film took my breath away. If there was a more beautiful woman in the world back then..........well, there just wasn&#39;t."
mQf3Ngg2cks,Gong Li looks like an Asian Madonna here.
mQf3Ngg2cks,"It’s on Amazon Prime in the U.K. at the moment for free.  Barry Norman put it on his Top 10 Best List of 1995, so that’s what got me on to this film."
mQf3Ngg2cks,Just saw it. Liked. Gong Li is an awesome actress

6PKq7YSpO6c,Yasssss lol 😂
6PKq7YSpO6c,It&#39;s like The Parent Trap...before The Parent Trap. You know the &#39;61 version with Hayley Mills before the &#39;98 one with Lindsay Loha-<br><br><b>JOKE ABORTED</b>

6PKq7YSpO6c,"RIP, Vincenzo."
6PKq7YSpO6c,Cute couples
6PKq7YSpO6c,I like this trailer of Olisen twins they bring Rodger and Diana together. Rodger never liked Clarise his girl got adopted
6PKq7YSpO6c,The Olsen twins movie like the parent trap. When Rodger fell in love Clairse she really loves kids like
6PKq7YSpO6c,Wish the olsen twins were young again!💜💙
6PKq7YSpO6c,to be honest i hate the olsen twins
6PKq7YSpO6c,This Reminds me of the parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,My Fav still till this day 😍
6PKq7YSpO6c,"I remember this movie when I was a kid. Movies like this are usually always good but also unrealistic. For example, I highly doubt that the millionaire father would choose Kirstie Alley&#39;s plain jane, baggy t-shirt wearing self over the skinny blonde haired sexy dressing girlfriend. But I guess that&#39;s why this is a movie cuz this doesn&#39;t really happen in real life. But super cute movie"
6PKq7YSpO6c,I remember this movie. Why do people think it&#39;s a parent trap rip off?? This movie is 3 years before that one.
6PKq7YSpO6c,This is like parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,Future   stepmother  was  too  bussy    thats   what  made  movie   wonderful
6PKq7YSpO6c,For some reason I forgot Lindsey Lohan was in the parent trap and I was thinking it was Mary Kate and Ashley in that movie . And I was sitting here thinking like how is this not the parent trap ?? This is the parent trap lol.
6PKq7YSpO6c,"Love their movies so much, especially this one. ❤️"
6PKq7YSpO6c,This is literally just like the parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,The big bad witch... Better than what I would have said
6PKq7YSpO6c,Marykate Olsen Ashley Olsen are my two favorite twin sisters
6PKq7YSpO6c,"No, it does not and nonne has a right to tell another now to live. IT WAS NOT Ashelynn, nor was it Angela (me). It is identity theft"
6PKq7YSpO6c,Rodger Callaway and Diana in it takes two Rodger find a girl from the Callaway lack they have 2 traffic kids bring them back together 4 ever
6PKq7YSpO6c,my childhood
6PKq7YSpO6c,"Young M,A<br>Lu Lu"
6PKq7YSpO6c,mary kate and Ashley  :))))) love themmmmmmm
6PKq7YSpO6c,XD I am only here cause one of my frands said it was filmed at camp miniyowe and indeed it was
6PKq7YSpO6c,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PKq7YSpO6c&amp;t=0m19s"">0:19</a> She was Jessie in The Parent Trap (1998) with Lindsay Lohan, Natasha Richardson, and Dennis Quaid, right?"
6PKq7YSpO6c,It is such a copycat of parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,i hate this ewwwww
6PKq7YSpO6c,This what a mixture of Friends and Full House would look like.
6PKq7YSpO6c,this a big ripoff of Parent Trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,Isnt dis like the parent trap?
6PKq7YSpO6c,i had this on VHS and was obsessed with this movie! i still know every line!
6PKq7YSpO6c,the original parent trap was in 1961 the 1998 version was a remake of the 61 original. So yes this move is a copy of it just how Fast and the Furious pretty much copied Point Break
6PKq7YSpO6c,I love the Olsen twins
6PKq7YSpO6c,"Everyone, the parent trap was made AFTER this movie came out"
6PKq7YSpO6c,This movie reminds me of the parent trap. I think the parent trap was way better.
6PKq7YSpO6c,I like Diane in this movie
6PKq7YSpO6c,is it good are bad leave a comment below
6PKq7YSpO6c,yeah and should I watch this movie are nah
6PKq7YSpO6c,love love love LOVE THOSE TWINS SO CUTE AND WHEN THEY WERE ON FULL HOUSE LOVE LOVE THEM leave a comment on my comment if you feel the same way
6PKq7YSpO6c,the old times where everything was good and now there a whores s*** prostitutes
6PKq7YSpO6c,It Takes Two-1995<br>Parent Trap-1998<br>So stop saying that this is a COPY of that movie because it is not.
6PKq7YSpO6c,Taken From The Amazing Panda Adventure 1996 VHS
6PKq7YSpO6c,How did they get away with using this story line without calling it a remake? It&#39;s a blatant copy of the Parent Trap. They must have paid someone to use it. It&#39;s the exact same plot.
6PKq7YSpO6c,parent trap and au pair hybrid
6PKq7YSpO6c,&quot;They&#39;ll have to ditch the big bad witch!&quot; Favorite line in this trailer!
6PKq7YSpO6c,es igual a juego de gemelas omg!
6PKq7YSpO6c,my favourite part in the film is when Amanda rips Clarice&#39;s dress exposing her knickers and stockings with garterbelt (this was later used in Just for laughs veil fail pranks and rugrats in paris movie with better modifications so the whole dress never falls apart)
6PKq7YSpO6c,parent trap?
6PKq7YSpO6c,"This is a very cute movie:) Funny, too! :)"
OXc0-EME0C8,Richard III Skeleton 2023
OXc0-EME0C8,Evil Gandalf
OXc0-EME0C8,Makes Sauron look like an amateur :)
OXc0-EME0C8,Please upload youtube 🎥
OXc0-EME0C8,Ian mckellen is a sheksperian genius. I love him in the lord of the rings and the hobbit and so much more but ian mckellen is the king of shekapere and he could play any sheksperian character this actor is such a genius
OXc0-EME0C8,never saw it
OXc0-EME0C8,Excellent.
OXc0-EME0C8,"The interesting of this movie is that it looks modern, but the language spoken is not. And it works wonder well."
OXc0-EME0C8,"The movie may be good (I haven&#39;t seen it), but this trailer looks like unwatchable &#39;90s kitsch."
OXc0-EME0C8,"If you have not seen this film, fix that immediately!"
OXc0-EME0C8,Shakespeare... with tanks!<br>What&#39;s not to love?
OXc0-EME0C8,Holy crap I have been searching for this film forever now I couldn&#39;t remember the name but I saw it in 9th grade twenty years ago and it was so damn memorable but I couldn&#39;t remember the name . This is great just made my day :)
OXc0-EME0C8,&#39;&#39;My kingdom for a jeep&#39;&#39;
OXc0-EME0C8,I wonder if Ian McKellen and Nigel Hawthorn ever dated.
OXc0-EME0C8,BTS V&#39;s insta story rechard 3
OXc0-EME0C8,Looks decent! Anyone know where I can find Richard and Richard 2? Obviously I can’t just watch Richard 3 without seeing the previous films.
OXc0-EME0C8,"Ah, now is the winter of our discount tents made glorious summer by this son of Millets."
OXc0-EME0C8,"Esta película se ve bastante interesante.<br>Además me siento algo representado, ya que tanto mi bisabuelo, como mi abuelo, y mi padre, por parte de mi familia paterna, se llaman o se llamaban Ricardo, y por ello yo vendría siendo, en cierto modo, Ricardo IV.<br>No sería Ricardo III, pero estaría cerca. XD."
OXc0-EME0C8,"There&#39;s an Amazing Australian film like this of MacBeth from 2006<br>They are a Scottish Mob family in Melbourne, the Horsemen are Biker Gang Members, the Witches are Gothic School Girls and the sword fights are Shootouts in the city and tunnels and bushland"
OXc0-EME0C8,Okay this is confusing and completely inaccurate Richard the third lived in 1400
OXc0-EME0C8,Magneto<br>Iron Man <br>Professor McGonagall <br>Professor Horace Slughorn <br>Mar-Vel Captain Marvel former boss and enemy
OXc0-EME0C8,"For anyone looking for the music that starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc0-EME0C8&amp;t=1m52s"">1:52</a>, it&#39;s Belshazzar&#39;s Feast &#39;Then Sing Aloud to God&#39;. (The version in the trailer is edited a bit, though.)"
OXc0-EME0C8,Robert hahahah perfect
OXc0-EME0C8,A cheesy commercial for a brilliant film....
OXc0-EME0C8,The trailer makes it look like they wanted this to be shown as a double feature together with Die Hard 3.
OXc0-EME0C8,"Near the end, when King Richard&#39;s jeep gets stuck in the mud and soldiers on horseback ride on past , he cries out &quot;A horse,  a horse, my kingdom for a horse...&quot;"
OXc0-EME0C8,"I distinctly remember coming home one night in 1997, turning on the TV and stumbling upon this film. It was the scene in the morgue where Ian McKellen talks to Kristin Scott Thomas. I was utterly amazed with this masterpiece of cinematography and it is still one of my favorite ones."
OXc0-EME0C8,1984?
OXc0-EME0C8,IS LIKE TITUS And romeo  and juliet.
OXc0-EME0C8,Of course they have to make it about Nazis. Might as well call it Edward VIII.. lol
OXc0-EME0C8,B
OXc0-EME0C8,maggie smith- hasn&#39;t aged a day.
OXc0-EME0C8,"What song is that at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc0-EME0C8&amp;t=1m52s"">1:52</a>"
OXc0-EME0C8,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc0-EME0C8&amp;t=0m50s"">0:50</a> Stop! Is Iron Man yelling at Magnito?"
OXc0-EME0C8,Between this and the Hopkins version of “Titus”. It’s hard to say what my favorite Shakespeare adaptation is. Both are great.
OXc0-EME0C8,I like his wild boar.
OXc0-EME0C8,How many killings?
OXc0-EME0C8,"This movie is a horrible presentation of a William Shakespeare play.<br>Shakespeare died in 1616<br>and wrote a story of a king in 1483. <br>YET the costumes are 1940 fashion and the characters are driving in cars not invented until the 1900&#39;s<br> Meanwhile, the vocals are not only spoken in Shakespeare&#39;s horrid  stage-play style of poetry writing (I&#39;ll never understand why people like that) BUT the vocals are not recorded well so inaudible most of the time ranging from mumbles to screetches.  Meanwhile, the background music is so loud its deafening.<br>If the director was aiming for a modern theme on a story of ancient history, such as has been done with the fictional story of Romeo &amp; Juliet (Leonardo DiCaprio), it doesn&#39;t work here because this is actual history and shouldnt be &#39;time altered&#39;.<br>Great cast of actors in a horrible movie."
OXc0-EME0C8,"This looks fucking retarded.  Great job, Hollywood jews!"
OXc0-EME0C8,richard 3 reich
OXc0-EME0C8,"At the beginning, the narrator sounded it like a bond film"
OXc0-EME0C8,Never mock your Royal Children only correct them!
OXc0-EME0C8,Man Richard the lionheart was a man guy.
OXc0-EME0C8,Excellent!
OXc0-EME0C8,"i love the ending, where he shoots his own man through the brain, then leaps into an inferno laughing his head off while a jazzy upbeat Al Jolson track kicks off! <br><br>a fantastic wicked villain"
OXc0-EME0C8,MAGNIFICA
OXc0-EME0C8,"A movie ahead of its time with many important stories from what happened during the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th century with some liberty here and there, some dark humor, excellent choice of actors . They don&#39;t make movies like this anymore . ( wow Maggie Smith looked old back then still in Downtown Abbey show she looks the same strange ?? )"
OXc0-EME0C8,What the fuck is this?
OXc0-EME0C8,Richard the turd.
OXc0-EME0C8,Everyone complains about spoilers in modern day trailers yet this one spoils a ton of the film lol.
OXc0-EME0C8,this looks epic. cannot believe that I did not see this.
OXc0-EME0C8,so metal...
OXc0-EME0C8,"Actually, for a movie that good, the trailer is rather unpalatable and perhaps misleading..."
OXc0-EME0C8,Frank Underwood is based off of Richard
OXc0-EME0C8,"What the hell is this? I expected a 15th Century historical representation of Richard III. This looks like a mid-Twentieth Century iteration of the Shakespearean play, which by the way is not historically accurate, because of political considerations concerning the Tudor dynasty."
OXc0-EME0C8,never thought i&#39;d see richard III as hitler..
OXc0-EME0C8,As it has never been told before? It&#39;s a pretty old play. it&#39;s been told exactly this way for centuries.
OXc0-EME0C8,And Englands flag at the time was The three lions of England on a red backround and the fluer de lis of France against a blue backround on a qaurtred flag
OXc0-EME0C8,This is Richard III of England right who ruled in late medieval times and was not a Nazi and existed 450 years before Hitlers rise
OXc0-EME0C8,God bless us and to our family!!!
OXc0-EME0C8,Your brain fu-ked. Your brain off. What is the culture? Nothing.
OXc0-EME0C8,"I really don&#39;t know what to make of the film.  Some of it is absolutely sublime -- the transposition to a totalitarian state is brilliant and conveys to the modern audience exactly how chilling Shakespeare meant the rise of Richard III to be, lying, cheating and murdering his way to the top, all the while managing to convince everyone -- from the women he seduces to the confederates he first wins to his cause and then betrays and has slaughtered when he has no further need of them -- that he is their ally.   Unlike so many &quot;modern&quot; versions of Shakespeare, it is completely on point.<br><br>On the other hand, they have certainly taken some liberties with the story.  Richmond waking before the battle and saying he has enjoyed the sweetest sleep ever conveys the impression that this is because he has enjoyed some great sex beforehand (and is about to enjoy some more), rather than having had the ghosts of all of Richard&#39;s victims wishing him success in his dreams, which is a pretty key point of Shakespeare&#39;s version.  And Queen Margaret&#39;s oh-so-prophetic curse at the beginning of the play has been lost.<br><br>Still, the gamble certainly pays off -- and once again (as he did with &quot;Macbeth&quot;), Sir Ian is absolutely perfect in the role."
OXc0-EME0C8,I have only seen parts of this film but Ian McKellen gave a phenomenal performance as the controversial York king. One of these days I am going to watch this from start to finish. The cast is just GREAT!!!
OXc0-EME0C8,"ach ihr briten , das böse am briten ist halt deutsch , gell . drum heissen sie auch haus windsor und nicht mehr haus hanover ."
OXc0-EME0C8,A fantastic adaption!
OXc0-EME0C8,"The true monster is the length of the drama, making it as hard as possible to finish shortly before a test. That&#39;s actually the real meaning of it. Also, Shakespeare is ennervating with his damn over-the-top passion. That&#39;s fine in your leisure, but not necessarily in a serious context..."
OXc0-EME0C8,Magneto vs Iron Man
OXc0-EME0C8,I didn&#39;t know that Professor McGonnagall had a son called Gandalf.
OXc0-EME0C8,Great playwright. I still think Macbeth is a better villian lol XD
OXc0-EME0C8,A blu-ray release would be nice...
OXc0-EME0C8,"God, it&#39;s like the narrator can&#39;t decide if he&#39;s doing an American or British accent."
OXc0-EME0C8,I fucking love this film but this trailer is just so... urgh
OXc0-EME0C8,This movie made Richard III into one of my heroes.  It also has one of the greatest seduction scenes in all of film.
OXc0-EME0C8,"Absolutely one of my all-time favourites. Saw it many times, still have to get the DVD. Superbly filmed, a brilliant cast, and the way they incorporated some of the landmark buildings in the story is really great. Ian McKellen is pure evil in this and boy, does he do a good job at being evil."
OXc0-EME0C8,I love Laurence Olivier&#39;s version but wow this looks cool!
OXc0-EME0C8,what is the name of the song near the end
xjPZbigB4NA,John Cale.

i1o_PO3ridY,"classic lines in this movie. Buckwheats! and everyone I show this movie to, loves it."
i1o_PO3ridY,Great film!
i1o_PO3ridY,"I think it may be a underated movie, this is a really good one, for those who understand it. <br>It&#39;s originale, and at the same time it got everything. Every good little detail that most other movies lack.<br>And first class acting. This chemistry between Walken and Garcia is very interesting, memorable."
i1o_PO3ridY,Nunn?! Forsyte?! What about Steve Buscemi?
i1o_PO3ridY,BOAT DRINKS PEOPLE.
i1o_PO3ridY,i am what im!!!
i1o_PO3ridY,aahh yes.......90&#39;s movie trailers with that deep voiced dialogue:) I miss this era of film. The trailers were kind of corny but the movies were really cool. today it&#39;s kind of the opposite as the trailers are epic but most films are disappointing.
i1o_PO3ridY,@painey86 Absolutely right voice over man sounds like a prick
i1o_PO3ridY,FECAL FREAK
i1o_PO3ridY,what a hideous trailer for a phenomenal film
i1o_PO3ridY,"there&#39;s no shiny briefcase McGuffin in this script, like in Pulp Fiction. Truth be told, Scott Rosenberg is a writer to be reckoned with (or at least was) -- Things to Do in Denver, Beautiful Girls, Con Air, High Fidelity, Gone in 60 Seconds, Armageddon . . . Of Rosenberg&#39;s bad films, you have Impostor and (the wonderful) Highway. "
i1o_PO3ridY,"Perfect movie, just freaking perfect! Violent, funny, romantic, moral without being preachy, it&#39;s flawless. Scotty Rosenberg, you knocked it outta the park!"
i1o_PO3ridY,BAD ASS MOVIE
i1o_PO3ridY,The whole fucking movie in a 1 min 55 second trailer.
i1o_PO3ridY,"damn this one&#39;s bringing out the worst in our comments.  great film, one i&#39;ll see again and again."
i1o_PO3ridY,@nuclearjew  and anybody gives a fuck about your opinion your name is nuclear jew
i1o_PO3ridY,@nuclearjew go to hell!!! all hail Jimmy the Saint!!!
i1o_PO3ridY,"@nuclearjew Saw this in a theater after your Back Street Boys concert in &#39;94, making you about 15?
Not mad at you, dickweed, just have little tolerance for those with no clue as to the derivation of words/terms in their own vernacular.
&quot;Boat drinks&quot;, cool! &quot;Buckwheats&quot; cool! &quot;Dickweed&quot;, enlightened.....ahhhh......"
i1o_PO3ridY,"@scottythesaint  Everyone was so caught up in the hysteria about Pulp Fiction (a great movie), &amp; this one was wrongfully compared to that... &amp; died a very sad death, to live forever in the shadow... It&#39;s a classic. Walken, Loyd, Garcia, Williams, Forsythe, Buscheme, Cobb, etc., jesus........."
i1o_PO3ridY,"Agred, it&#39;s entertaining and these kids today will believe anything."
i1o_PO3ridY,come on dude. I saw that you uploaded 3 or 4 scenes from the movie. You can&#39;t be serious... This is a kick ass movie. Pulp Fiction is a great movie too. We mustn&#39;t compare these 2 movies. Totally different stories. I can&#39;t find any similarities between these 2
i1o_PO3ridY,brooklyn jimmie flatbush ave best pizza and best buckwheats
i1o_PO3ridY,Mr. shoosh is coming 2 give u big hot buckwheats
i1o_PO3ridY,"pulp fiction is an amazing movie, but it has nothing to do with this one... this is one o my fav movies, its full of memorable scenes and the dialogue is unforgettable"
i1o_PO3ridY,"That ad in no way does justice to the film, it made it look atrocious."
i1o_PO3ridY,I mean not directly opposed to your judgement of Pulp Fiction being a good movie.
i1o_PO3ridY,"I didn&#39;t mean to be insulting with the &quot;f***n****f***&quot;. That was uncool. Just wanted to make a point.
Else I think I&#39;m correct, but not directly opposed to your judgement. Sorry for the wording."
i1o_PO3ridY,"Why do you compare two completely different things?
This one&#39;s nothing like Pulp Fiction. This here stuff&#39;s about morals, and values, and integrity.
Pulp Fiction is about incredible visuals and &quot;fuck-nigga-fuck-what-a-strange-and-wonderful-world&quot; kinda stuff."
i1o_PO3ridY,Any one get the ending Ive seen it about five times me and my mates just argue ...there not dead are they it was just a guy telling a story and they got of with the money ?
i1o_PO3ridY,AHAHAH they used cues from Black Rain for this trailer.
i1o_PO3ridY,One of the most underrated films EVER!
qiAyu1qKkfE,"I rarely comment. This preview does no justice to this amazing film. If it looked boring, please do yourself a favor and trust that everyone who reviewed it loved this film. It is an underrecognized masterpiece."

cujiHDeqnHY,テクニカラーキャメラで撮影の映画作品。パステル調だが、原色が強調された発色。これは、撮影技術で見せる映画である。<br>主人公の男は、右よく無政府主義者にしては、気がふれていて、かなり、笑わせる。<br>人物のバストショットを、クレーンキャメラを滑らかに移動させながら撮影する方法は、画期的である。<br>そして、ラストシーンのタクシー内のルームミラーに映る、ニューヨークの夜の街。<br>この作品は、このシーンで終わるのであるから、宗教学的な作品である。
cujiHDeqnHY,I drive a taxi now I know why Travis went nuts
cujiHDeqnHY,what? no crazy bass noise? no single piano notes trailing off into oblivion? lol. No quick cuts and flashes of the main characters crescendoing into one person saying a single short statement? lol. This is MADNESS! lol.
cujiHDeqnHY,even the trailer is a cinematic classic  🚕
cujiHDeqnHY,Scorsese’s second greatest movie after GoodFellas.
cujiHDeqnHY,Trailer looks intresting looking for the movie&#39;s Cannes. Premiere
cujiHDeqnHY,"Reminds me of when the Feds, came for me.....100% disabled Army veteran....PTSD....."
cujiHDeqnHY,"I don&#39;t think Travis&#39; narrative at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cujiHDeqnHY&amp;t=0m53s"">0:53</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cujiHDeqnHY&amp;t=1m06s"">1:06</a> was actually in the movie. After watching this masterpiece countless times, it&#39;s incredible to hear this part for the first time."
cujiHDeqnHY,Oh how gorgeous Robert de niro
cujiHDeqnHY,It’s so weird to me that De Niro was in godfather part two before this
cujiHDeqnHY,"<b>&quot;I like Jodie Foster characters street name  &quot;EASY&quot; Bangkok-Johnnie. BTW  Martin Scorsese stole the song &quot;Be My Baby&quot;  in his first movie &quot;Mean Streets&quot;. No permission from Phil Spector. Later  Scorsese had to pay back in millions USD</b>  <a href=""https://youtu.be/1vsMiFlNK7E"">https://youtu.be/1vsMiFlNK7E</a>"
cujiHDeqnHY,"Great film, legit underrated af"
cujiHDeqnHY,I was wondering where Robert De Niro was.<br>Darn he looked different when he was young.
cujiHDeqnHY,"Watched this film with high expectations, I mean it&#39;s De Niro, Foster and Scorsese! De Niro was phenomenal but I felt underwhelmed overall. The whole arc with Besty and Palantine didn&#39;t feel relevant, why did he want to kill the Senator anyway and how does it tie with his intention to &quot;clean&quot; the city of &quot;trash&quot;. He doesn&#39;t even know the person and it ended with a failed assassination and Travis escaped, so why bother lol. It didn&#39;t add anything to him wanting to save Jodie Foster, he was gonna save her from the goons regardless. He survived, became a hero but the failed assassination had to impact whatsoever."
cujiHDeqnHY,Is it just me or young deniro looks a bit like djokovic?
cujiHDeqnHY,My Favorite Movie of all time
cujiHDeqnHY,"I do love Joker more than this, but this definitely isn&#39;t bad at ALL."
cujiHDeqnHY,The fuck is that trailer spoiling the movie lol
cujiHDeqnHY,Movies driven by society <br><br>Joker <br>Taxi Driver<br>Carrie <br>American Psycho
cujiHDeqnHY,The music 👌
cujiHDeqnHY,I seriously couldn&#39;t recognize Robert de Niro for sometime in the trailer
cujiHDeqnHY,damn right it&#39;s Taxi Driver
cujiHDeqnHY,"The irishman brought me here, amazing film"
cujiHDeqnHY,I&#39;d say this and Deer Hunter are my favorite movies from the 70s.
cujiHDeqnHY,Ronald Reagan brought me here.
cujiHDeqnHY,Why do people keep saying that the Joker brought them here?
cujiHDeqnHY,Great film
cujiHDeqnHY,"i just watched this for the first time ever because people call this one of the greatest movies ever made and i gotta say, this movie was boring as hell. its like a day in the life of a stalker."
cujiHDeqnHY,Why did Alvin and the chipmunks reference this movie
cujiHDeqnHY,Classic ❤️
cujiHDeqnHY,here after the joker
cujiHDeqnHY,So this is why Robert De Niro was in Joker. I have to see this movie now
cujiHDeqnHY,"&quot;For my whole life, I didn&#39;t know if I even really existed&quot;"
cujiHDeqnHY,Martin Scorsese&#39;s:<br><br><br> &#39;The Uber driver&#39;.
cujiHDeqnHY,Travis Bickle the original incel?
cujiHDeqnHY,Fuck Joker
cujiHDeqnHY,Is it just me or does anyone feel like this trailer seems longer than 3 minutes
cujiHDeqnHY,Damn Morgan Freeman was narrating in the 70’s too 😂
cujiHDeqnHY,not to be an annoying hipster bitch but i wish people could just appreciate this movie instead of just being like “oh joker brought me here!” like watch the damn movie. you’ll like it if you liked joker i’m sure. i love taxi driver and to see De Niro in both movies was so precious to me. pls watch the movie instead of just glancing at it as a movie that’s just similar
cujiHDeqnHY,do not see this movie please it&#39;s soo fucking boring
cujiHDeqnHY,you talkin’ to me
cujiHDeqnHY,The movies are recommended to watch... <br><br>Joker(2019)<br>The Shining (1980)<br>Taxi Driver (1976)<br>American Psycho (2000)<br>Scarface (1983)<br>Godfather (1972)<br>Godfather II (1974)<br>Godfather III (1990)<br>Pulp Fiction (1994)
cujiHDeqnHY,Did peter boyle ever have hair on his dome? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
cujiHDeqnHY,The new Joker tried to be this and failed. Leave it to the professionals.
cujiHDeqnHY,the joker movie is all in travis bickles head
cujiHDeqnHY,Never realized how dork-looking he was in younger years.
cujiHDeqnHY,My fucking life brought me here
cujiHDeqnHY,"I really want to hear what people who this AFTER Joker think of Taxi Driver, I saw it almost 20 years ago and its stuck with me since"
cujiHDeqnHY,"damn, all the times I saw <br>Taxi Driver<br>I never watched the trailer<br>that trailer is better than a lot of whole films"
cujiHDeqnHY,"Hmm, I didn&#39;t knew that Novak Djokovic is playing in a movie"
cujiHDeqnHY,I feel like I just watched a whole episode of the Twilight Zone
cujiHDeqnHY,Here after joker
cujiHDeqnHY,Its a good movie but personally I dont really like the trailer. I think they could have made it more compact.
cujiHDeqnHY,Good old times and good<br>Movies . Today’s bullshit you can’t even call movies
cujiHDeqnHY,"Man were trailers LAME, back in the day. AMIRITE?"
cujiHDeqnHY,I&#39;ve been here before the joker you uncultured swines
cujiHDeqnHY,This trailer has alot of the best parts of the movie in it.
cujiHDeqnHY,WTF ROBERT DE NIRO
cujiHDeqnHY,Ain&#39;t it fun when you feel like you just got to get a gun?
cujiHDeqnHY,jodie foster is so pretty even before fame.. wtf
cujiHDeqnHY,Joker movie got me here too. But was that Morgan Freeman’s voice for the trailer?
cujiHDeqnHY,Quanto caaaaaaaaxxxxxo era brutta Jodie Foster
cujiHDeqnHY,JOKER
cujiHDeqnHY,Who&#39;s here after watching joker movie?
cujiHDeqnHY,Joker brought me here
cujiHDeqnHY,"Rocky was a great film but I would&#39;ve given the Oscar to Taxi Driver.  The ending sealed it.  Highly unexpected and so ironic.  A vigilante, a ticking time bomb is turned into a hero.  Taxi Driver is a great, great film."
cujiHDeqnHY,Can anyone that has seen the movie confirm if he was talking to him or not? I really need to know.
cujiHDeqnHY,Anyone here after Joker?
cujiHDeqnHY,Is it just me.. or is it getting crazier out there...
cujiHDeqnHY,Whos here after Joker?
cujiHDeqnHY,Still better than any of Marvel films.
cujiHDeqnHY,Looks kinda lame.
cujiHDeqnHY,Joker
cujiHDeqnHY,Taxi driver 2 : rise of uber<br>Taxi driver 3 : ola didi saga

cujiHDeqnHY,Next summer The Lytf and uber  driver are you fucking with me will be the sign <br>In  your favorite theaters next summer
cujiHDeqnHY,Taxi Driver Smashed the System
cujiHDeqnHY,Robert De Niro needed to brush his teeth more back then.
cujiHDeqnHY,Best movie of the 70s
cujiHDeqnHY,"I love this film so much. In fact, I have edited a music video out of this movie in my channell.<br>If u guys have time, pls checc it out...<br>Thanks. Have a nice day :)"
cujiHDeqnHY,"I&#39;m saddened by the people who only got to here from Joker and for the pop culture fans this is from the director of Shutter Island, Hugo and Wolf of Wall Street and I am glad to mentioned that these films you saw isn&#39;t even his top 10"
cujiHDeqnHY,They showed this at the Castro theater in the 1990&#39;s I almost went with our student advisor.
cujiHDeqnHY,"Had to stop half way, the trailer was giving away too much"
cujiHDeqnHY,"What&#39;s your dream..<br>Me : night, (walking alone)streets of new York with the theme music of taxi driver in my ear...."
cujiHDeqnHY,"..wait a minute , though"
cujiHDeqnHY,This is the single greatest movie in the history of the world.
cujiHDeqnHY,This is really long for a trailer but i was occupied by it and didn&#39;t notice
cujiHDeqnHY,Classic
cujiHDeqnHY,It&#39;s awesome to see how different trailers were back in the day.
cujiHDeqnHY,Wtf is this movie about?
cujiHDeqnHY,why does America produce so many alienated drifters with guns....we need help
cujiHDeqnHY,I didn’t realised how attractive Robert de Niro was as a young man.💐
cujiHDeqnHY,"This is my favorite movie of all time. An accurate and distubing study of isolationism, physchological trauma. That somehow i identify with on a deep level, and i think a lot of people would agree with me. A beautiful work of art, the neon streetlights reflecting from the pools of water. The streets filled with people altrhough travis is never in a group. The score is phenomenal the drums rattling signifying the hate and rage that&#39;s boiling inside of him. Followed by a smooth jazz tune signifying fantasies and false hopes created."
cujiHDeqnHY,Awesome trailer just like movie👍🏻
cujiHDeqnHY,2019??
cujiHDeqnHY,"No homo, Robert de Niro was a fucking gorgeous man in his youth."
cujiHDeqnHY,&quot;Getting organized&quot;<br>I think you mean organi-sized
q7vg8uGzLts,LOL. The trailer doesn&#39;t even care about the movie. It just talks about how awesome Jackie Chan is 😃
q7vg8uGzLts,Love how they made The Bronx look like Vancouver. Movies really are magical. <br><br>Those mountains that were seen in the background in some scenes must have been Yonkers.
q7vg8uGzLts,2022.....wait it&#39;s 2023
q7vg8uGzLts,I watched this as a kid and it always stuck with me but I never knew the name! Glad to be able to find it after all these years.
q7vg8uGzLts,"So this is his first movie from America, so sad. I wish he get their sooner. His hong kong movies was so great."
q7vg8uGzLts,Pure entertainer.. Wish he doesn&#39;t get it influenced by the Hollywood. His movies was always a hit since 1980s in India.. there are theatre which used to keep Huge cutout of Jakie outside the theatre
q7vg8uGzLts,It should be Rumble in Vancouver.
q7vg8uGzLts,"Nice, they used George S. Clinton&#39;s Mortal Kombat score for this trailer."
q7vg8uGzLts,Great movie!
q7vg8uGzLts,Jackie is why I WILL NEVER WATCH WIRE-FU
q7vg8uGzLts,&quot;he does all his own stunts&quot;<br><br>Who you trying to kid? I&#39;ve seen very often that Jacky doesn&#39;t do ALL his own stunts. Sure he does probably way more stunts than any other actor. But just for example because it&#39;s only 2 days since I re-watched Action Hunter I guess. Have a look at that boss fiht st the end when he does his side-spinning kick. It&#39;s shows one time in slow motion and one time normal motion. you guys really need to watch a bit closer or more carefully and not just believe anything that anyone tells you.
q7vg8uGzLts,first movie i watched starring jackie chan
q7vg8uGzLts,The song is from mortal kombat! 😂
q7vg8uGzLts,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7vg8uGzLts&amp;t=0m20s"">0:20</a> The Action Hero who does all his own stunts: Jackie Chan."
q7vg8uGzLts,Love this movie ❤️.
q7vg8uGzLts,"I remember heading into Liverpool city centre to watch this when I was a kid.  It was a complete adventure for me and my friends as we were only young and wouldn&#39;t normally head into the city at night but it was only showing at the city centre Odeon!  We were already JC fans but this movie literally blew me away - the fight scenes, the stunts, the humour... it was and still is a masterpiece!  We came out of the theatre and headed to the bus station and I can remember looking nervously down every alleyway for &#39;gangs&#39; who might chase us on motorbikes ;)  A night I&#39;ll never forget... thanks Jackie Chan! :D"
q7vg8uGzLts,This is one of the most awesome trailers ever! 90s were amazing!
q7vg8uGzLts,How could they make every single thing look and sound so cool in the 90s. New line cinema was so fn sick omg
q7vg8uGzLts,We need a reboot tony ja should get the role
q7vg8uGzLts,does anyone know  the name of the song played in the dance club scene? some techno stuff
q7vg8uGzLts,Extraordinary
q7vg8uGzLts,I wouldn&#39;t be Surprised if there was a Model figure of THAT LAMBO With Paint Messed up And Jackie Chan Figure Inside of it With the Saw sticking out !<br><br>It&#39;s Pop Culture Man !!!
q7vg8uGzLts,YES Mortal Kombat Fever !<br><br>Yeah one of my Earliest movies of Jackie Chan
q7vg8uGzLts,The illest action movie trailer of all time period.
q7vg8uGzLts,I came here for that instrumental. This is the same instrumental in Mortal Kombat back in the 90s lol<br>What an EPIC trailer 🔥
q7vg8uGzLts,“Are you ok?”  ... “No!” … and he runs towards the fight anyway.
q7vg8uGzLts,HAPPY 25th ANNIVERSARY to the US release of RUMBLE IN THE BRONX!!! 🙂
q7vg8uGzLts,Jackie Chan is as much legend as Bruce lee
q7vg8uGzLts,Ok but wtf is the movie about exactly? Worst trailer ever.
q7vg8uGzLts,"This his best film ever made  and armor of the god part 1,2 r next then procct a then project a 2 r then first strike then police story 1,3 r his best films ever made"
q7vg8uGzLts,"Are you okay? NO! ...As I kid I laughed SO hard. It just made sense that it&#39;d hurt, but you&#39;d never really hear someone say it out loud in movies back then."
q7vg8uGzLts,"Dating myself here, saw Rumble In the Bronx in the Theatre, when I was 11 years old back in &#39;95. It was and still is one of my favourite action, material arts movies. The stunts were amazing for the time. I had never seen a movie where a guy is being chased by the bad guys and has to jump from a parking parade to an apartment balcony! expect maybe the movie Marathon Man with  Dustin Hoffman (similar idea) two years later Mr.Nice Guy came out another awesome movie that i had wished i had seen in the theatre. The 90&#39;s were a great time to still go to the movies, it used to cost me as a kid $5 to go to the movies ha good luck with that now days!"
q7vg8uGzLts,My All time favorite movie wonderful superb great. Jacky Chan
q7vg8uGzLts,Look up &quot; Jackie Chan dubbed with streets of rage 2&quot; - I had a good laugh 🤣
q7vg8uGzLts,Haha I remember couldn&#39;t stop watching this trailer on video cassette
q7vg8uGzLts,"Movies and actors were amazing back then, now cinema is just a pile of garbage."
q7vg8uGzLts,"I remember renting Jackie Chan movies from Blockbuster back in the early 2000s, I was born in 96. My first movie probably Rush Hour. 2nd was Mr. Nice Guy, Rumble In the Bronx, JC: First Strike, Thunderbolt, RH 2 and 3, Police Story, Enter The Dragon (even tho he was a stunt in one scene). Love his movies"
q7vg8uGzLts,&quot;JACKIE CHAN&quot;.... Cue the Mortal Kombat song.
q7vg8uGzLts,well this oughta be a good movie
q7vg8uGzLts,when movies where movies man Jackie Chan was the man i will never forget that percussion beat so sick
q7vg8uGzLts,any 2020´s ?
q7vg8uGzLts,This trailer was on the Mortal Kombat VHS.
q7vg8uGzLts,"Rest in peace, Anita Mui.<br><br>You are always remembered."
q7vg8uGzLts,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7vg8uGzLts&amp;t=0m28s"">0:28</a> remember that theme from the Mortal Kombat movie?<br><br><br><br>Hint: Sub-zero&#39;s second appearance in the movie (walking down the stairs before freezing the warrior fighter)"
q7vg8uGzLts,Mr Chan I love u too muchh ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
q7vg8uGzLts,I remember this was one of New Line Cinemas attached trailers that played before Mortal Kombat in theatres. This and then the trailer for National Lampoon&#39;s Senior Trip.
q7vg8uGzLts,"One word for this: Chaotic. Mr. Michael Bay, you should watch the film and learn about real action cinema"
q7vg8uGzLts,Jackie Chan brought new York man twin towers and the south Bronx the heart of new York City where it all started man
q7vg8uGzLts,"LOL, this trailer is just &quot;It&#39;s a Jackie Chan action movie&quot; no hints at all saying what the story might be."
q7vg8uGzLts,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7vg8uGzLts&amp;t=0m30s"">0:30</a> mortal kombat a taste of things to come"
q7vg8uGzLts,When i first saw this movie. I was a fan and still am till this day
q7vg8uGzLts,This was actually one of my favorite Jackie Chan films this one who am I and first strike
q7vg8uGzLts,"What&#39;s that song called at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7vg8uGzLts&amp;t=0m33s"">0:33</a>?"
q7vg8uGzLts,I played in the movie rumble in the Bronx
q7vg8uGzLts,Does anyone know the name of the &quot;drum song&quot; in this trailer?
q7vg8uGzLts,"Super, fantastic"
q7vg8uGzLts,Is that Jim Cummings doing the narration?
q7vg8uGzLts,Wow I was like 12 when I watched this and ms doutfire  the 90s
q7vg8uGzLts,My favorite Jackie Chan movie
q7vg8uGzLts,1st saw this film in 97 at my aunt&#39;s house she rented some movies for the night we had rented mortal kombat but this film was placed in the wrong box so we had to watch this film instead and to this day this is my all time fav jackie chan film
q7vg8uGzLts,"Hey guys :) if you like Jackie, check out the video I made about him on my channel :)"
q7vg8uGzLts,Nostalgia meter through the roof
q7vg8uGzLts,The Buckethead song from Mortal Kombat???????
q7vg8uGzLts,Anita! RIP angel!
q7vg8uGzLts,생활의달인 나셨슴둥
q7vg8uGzLts,With the music of Mortal Kombat. :D
q7vg8uGzLts,My personal Top 5 JC movies...<br>1. Who Am I?<br>2. Rumble In The Bronx<br>3. Jackie Chan’s First Strike AKA Police Story 4<br>4. Super Cop<br>5. Rush Hour
q7vg8uGzLts,I remember I saw this movie during summer of 1996 visiting cousins at a drive in theatre(that was the first time and last time I went to a drive in theatre).
q7vg8uGzLts,The movie in which he broke his ankle and then twisted it back and went back to film. This guy....not just in the movies even in real life is to be messed with....<br><br>Who the fk dislocates their ankle and twists it back into place and go back to get business done?
q7vg8uGzLts,VINTAGE :D
q7vg8uGzLts,Forever a classic. Jackie Chan is the modern day Charlie Chaplin– but for Kung Fu enthusiasts.
q7vg8uGzLts,"Rush Hour, Karate Kid, Rumble in the bronx. All my fav movies by Jackie"
q7vg8uGzLts,Rumble in Vancouver
q7vg8uGzLts,this was the first jackie Chan movie I watched.  the last one I watched was just as perfect.  the music from the trailer is from the mk soundtrack btw.  I LOVE jackie and the awesomeness he brings.
q7vg8uGzLts,best actor..!!!!
q7vg8uGzLts,My first movie of Jackie Chan. Still my favorite of his.
q7vg8uGzLts,I remember how this movie made the bronx look like shit
q7vg8uGzLts,"decades later, this trailer is still so sick and exciting."
S82xxKIURF4,"Good, but the actors had inconsistent accents.   Some sounded like they were from Ontario,  while others sounded Irish.   Few sounded Nova Scotian."
S82xxKIURF4,Perhaps the worst film I have seen!
S82xxKIURF4,"I have to watch this, it&#39;s filmed in my hometown!"
S82xxKIURF4,ww.youtube.com/movie/margarets-museum apparently you can buy in online for $3.99
S82xxKIURF4,"so are you saying you didn&#39;t like the ending of the original story too?  Or just the way they did the ending in the film?  Because without the ending, it&#39;s just another CBC drama.  The ending is sudden and powerful, especially for 90&#39;s Canadian film.  The ending made it fantastic."
S82xxKIURF4,"I&#39;m not sure anyone will ever upload it.  Despite being an amazing film, It just isn&#39;t that popular.  I download most movies, but I made an exception for this one and bought it on amazon and I&#39;m glad I own it.  Everyone I show it to loves it.  Do the Canadian film industry a favour and buy a copy."
S82xxKIURF4,I love this movie.  I wish I could find it on DVD somewhere.  Its hard to find here
S82xxKIURF4,"It was based on a book by a local Cape Bretoner, maybe if you read it you would understand the ending&#39;s purpose better. It&#39;s a fabulous film."
S82xxKIURF4,This was filmed partly in cape Breton! Can&#39;t believe Helena Bonham carter was here!
S82xxKIURF4,"I started to watch this show on tv a couple days ago, because I heard The Rankin Family&#39;s song &quot;Chi mi na morbheanna&quot; playing in it lol"
S82xxKIURF4,I want to watch! I want to watch! I want to watch!
S82xxKIURF4,"This movie is very unique and different, but I love it :D None of the trailers do it justice, but I did see a much better trailer for it than this one. At least you can watch the movie on youtube now :)"
S82xxKIURF4,Award Winning! She should have won an award for this! 
S82xxKIURF4,"Aha! I&#39;ve never actually seen this movie, but they used my grandmother neighbour/family friends house for a few scenes of this movie, so I grew up hearing about it, and seeing videos of me and my cousins running around the set and crew bringing the equpment in, but this is the first clip I&#39;ve ever seen. Think I&#39;m going to have to watch it XD"
S82xxKIURF4,"@lovemeliketherain7 
Same here!
I would absolutly love to work in a movie with her! (:"
S82xxKIURF4,Me gusta esta pelicula... XD
S82xxKIURF4,i want to see this movie rlly bad
S82xxKIURF4,That&#39;s a pretty flat trailer for a very good movie.
S82xxKIURF4,huh...wow look how young she was... I wonder what year this movie was...

_d7KNUnJF4o,This is the wrong trailer... not the Brigid Berlin story
_d7KNUnJF4o,Love this show!
e3ZtOS4MCkk,"Fun Fact:<br>The teaser narrator is Nick Tate, who also narrated the trailers for<br><b>Jurassic Park</b><br><b>The Lost World</b><br><b>Rob Roy</b><br><b>CONGO</b><br><b>Clear &amp; Present Danger</b><br><b>GoldenEye</b><br><b>Tomorrow Never Dies</b><br>and many others."
e3ZtOS4MCkk,NASA should have just scrapped Shepard&#39;s Apollo 13 mission and moved Lovell&#39;s Apollo 14 mission. Shepard will be designated to Apollo 15.
e3ZtOS4MCkk,Music from Total Recall - what a score...
e3ZtOS4MCkk,Director Kazunori Yamauchi
e3ZtOS4MCkk,Still a good movie.
e3ZtOS4MCkk,The music is titled &quot;The Mutant&quot; from the Total Recall Soundtrack.
e3ZtOS4MCkk,This is fear similar to that of the “Alien” trailer. Except what happened was real.
e3ZtOS4MCkk,"You people have nothing better to do! Unfortunately,  neither do I!"
e3ZtOS4MCkk,23rd

e3ZtOS4MCkk,This movie is rated PG as it contains low level coarse language. Children below the age of 13 years may require parental guidance and direction.
e3ZtOS4MCkk,I watched this movie it was very intense!😖
e3ZtOS4MCkk,"That music at the end is just creepy. It perfectly encapsulates the horror of three men adrift out there in the void of space, desperate to get back home"
e3ZtOS4MCkk,"This a terrific teaser trailer. I just wish the whole thing was one continuous shot of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3ZtOS4MCkk&amp;t=0m12s"">0:12</a> the capsule with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3ZtOS4MCkk&amp;t=0m42s"">0:42</a> the montage of dialogue and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3ZtOS4MCkk&amp;t=0m51s"">0:51</a> the onscreen credits. That would&#39;ve been amazing."
e3ZtOS4MCkk,Rip bill paxton
e3ZtOS4MCkk,Who&#39;s watching this trailer in 2016??
e3ZtOS4MCkk,Now THIS is a teaser
e3ZtOS4MCkk,awesome movie
e3ZtOS4MCkk,"nice suspenseful trailer, however I don&#39;t like the creepy finishing background music at the very end"
e3ZtOS4MCkk,is it real?!?!?
e3ZtOS4MCkk,-Thread Locked
e3ZtOS4MCkk,This teaser rocked cinemas for Christmas 1994! It played in front of Dumb and Dumber for a summer 1995 release. Way better than the theatrical trailer that came out in the spring before the film&#39;s release.
