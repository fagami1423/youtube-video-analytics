rEnOoWs3FuA,I was looking for halloween themed movies and stumbled over this... is there anything halloween related in this film?<br><br><br>Seen it years ago but can&#39;t remember squat
rEnOoWs3FuA,"welp, been 3 years since anybody have commented"
rEnOoWs3FuA,"Well, there was supposed to be another sequel. From what I heard, the two guys go to Italy (to meet their new relatives, I suppose) &amp; wind up meeting Italian versions of themselves."
rEnOoWs3FuA,i loved the first one is it like the first one or not??
2GfZl4kuVNI,RIP Tom Sizemore
2GfZl4kuVNI,Hollywood have stopped making movies like this.. nowdays only wokeness and awardness spreading bullshit for most of the films and series
2GfZl4kuVNI,"The greatest Man in history, had no servants, and yet they called Him Master. He had no degree, and yet they called Him Teacher. He had no medicine, and yet He was called the Healer. He had no armies, and yet kings feared him. He won no military battles, and yet He conquered the world. He committed no crime, and yet they crucified Him. He was buried in a grave, and He is alive today. And His name is Jesus Christ in Greek, and in Hebrew Messiah Masía (Messiah)<br>                                     Father&#39;s Love Letter<br>                                An Intimate Message From God To You.<br><br>My Child,<br><br>You may not know me, <br>but I know everything about you. <br>Psalm 139:1 <br>I know when you sit down and when you rise up. <br>Psalm 139:2<br>I am familiar with all your ways. <br>Psalm 139:3<br>Even the very hairs on your head are numbered. <br>Matthew 10:29-31<br>For you were made in my image. <br>Genesis 1:27<br>In me you live and move and have your being.<br>Acts 17:28 <br>For you are my offspring. <br>Acts 17:28 <br>I knew you even before you were conceived. <br>Jeremiah 1:4-5 <br>I chose you when I planned creation. <br>Ephesians 1:11-12 <br>You were not a mistake, <br>for all your days are written in my book. <br>Psalm 139:15-16<br>I determined the exact time of your birth <br>and where you would live. <br>Acts 17:26 <br>You are fearfully and wonderfully made. <br>Psalm 139:14 <br>I knit you together in your mother&#39;s womb. <br>Psalm 139:13 <br>And brought you forth on the day you were born. <br>Psalm 71:6<br>I have been misrepresented <br>by those who don&#39;t know me.<br>John 8:41-44<br>I am not distant and angry, <br>but am the complete expression of love. <br>1 John 4:16 <br>And it is my desire to lavish my love on you. <br>1 John 3:1 <br>Simply because you are my child <br>and I am your Father. <br>1 John 3:1<br>I offer you more than your earthly father ever could. <br>Matthew 7:11 <br>For I am the perfect father. <br>Matthew 5:48 <br>Every good gift that you receive comes from my hand. <br>James 1:17<br>For I am your provider and I meet all your needs. <br>Matthew 6:31-33 <br>My plan for your future has always been filled with hope. <br>Jeremiah 29:11 <br>Because I love you with an everlasting love. <br>Jeremiah 31:3 <br>My thoughts toward you are countless <br>as the sand on the seashore.<br>Psalms 139:17-18<br>And I rejoice over you with singing. <br>Zephaniah <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GfZl4kuVNI&amp;t=3m17s"">3:17</a> <br>I will never stop doing good to you. <br>Jeremiah 32:40 <br>For you are my treasured possession. <br>Exodus 19:5 <br>I desire to establish you<br>with all my heart and all my soul. <br>Jeremiah 32:41 <br>And I want to show you great and marvelous things. <br>Jeremiah 33:3 <br>If you seek me with all your heart, <br>you will find me. <br>Deuteronomy 4:29 <br>Delight in me and I will give you <br>the desires of your heart. <br>Psalm 37:4 <br>For it is I who gave you those desires. <br>Philippians 2:13 <br>I am able to do more for you <br>than you could possibly imagine. <br>Ephesians 3:20 <br>For I am your greatest encourager. <br>2 Thessalonians 2:16-17<br>I am also the Father who comforts you <br>in all your troubles. <br>2 Corinthians 1:3-4 <br>When you are brokenhearted, <br>I am close to you. <br>Psalm 34:18 <br>As a shepherd carries a lamb, <br>I have carried you close to my heart. <br>Isaiah 40:11 <br>One day I will wipe away <br>every tear from your eyes. <br>Revelation 21:3-4 <br>And I&#39;ll take away all the pain <br>you have suffered on this earth.<br>Revelation 21:3-4 <br>I am your Father, and I love you <br>even as I love my son, Jesus.<br>John 17:23 <br>For in Jesus, my love for you is revealed. <br>John 17:26<br>He is the exact representation of my being. <br>Hebrews 1:3 <br>He came to demonstrate that I am for you, <br>not against you. <br>Romans 8:31 <br>And to tell you that I am not counting your sins.<br>2 Corinthians 5:18-19<br>Jesus died so that you and I could be reconciled. <br>2 Corinthians 5:18-19 <br>His death was the ultimate expression <br>of my love for you. <br>1 John 4:10<br>I gave up everything I loved<br>that I might gain your love. <br>Romans 8:31-32 <br>If you receive the gift of my son Jesus, <br>you receive me. <br>1 John 2:23<br>And nothing will ever separate you <br>from my love again.<br>Romans 8:38-39<br>Come home and I&#39;ll throw the biggest party <br>heaven has ever seen.<br>Luke 15:7 <br>I have always been Father, <br>and will always be Father.<br>Ephesians 3:14-15 <br>My question is…<br>Will you be my child? <br>John 1:12-13 <br>I am waiting for you. <br>Luke 15:11-32<br><br>Love, Your Dad<br>Almighty God<br>If God cannot be around sinful man, why﻿ on earth did he come here and hang out with 12 disciples, beggars, tax collectors, liars, thieves and whores?<br>John 3:16 <br> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>under tears of joy i received this holy truth, it took me awhile to collect myself.

Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you now and humbly ask for your forgiveness. LORD, I confess that I&#39;m a sinner and I&#39;ve broken your Holy Law. I realize that the penalty for sin is death. I believe that JESUS CHRIST suffered and died on the Cross to take the punishment for ALL of my sins. I believe JESUS rose from the dead and I accept Him as my personal Savior. From this moment forward I give you my heart and trust you to be the LORD of my life. Please forgive ALL of my sins and send your Spirit to help me do your will. I Love You, Lord Jesus. I Praise You, Jesus. I Thank You, Jesus. I shall follow you every day of my life.    <br>I thank you for your great love and accept your gift of eternal life, and I pray these things in JESUS name, Amen﻿ . Say this prayer faithfully, no matter what you feel, when you come to the point where you sincerely mean each word, with all your heart, something good spiritually will happen to you. You will experience Jesus, and HE will change your whole life in a very special way. You will see. A single saint fights back, and a thousand demons cry in agony. And you are that saint.<br><br>Jesus Will Never Leave Nor Forsake You<br>&#39;&#39;Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness. Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him and He shall bring it to pass.” Ps 37:3-5<br>Jesus Christ came into this world to reach those who feel that nobody cares. The Lord’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in Him. The Lord Jesus Christ does care and He is reaching the lonely and the desperate, the confused and the hurt, the depressed and the disillusioned. Jesus Christ is reaching out to you. <br>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Rom 5:8<br>As we turn away from our sin and turn to Christ we find forgiveness and freedom. <br>Jesus Christ is a Friend to the friendless.<br>He is a Helper to the helpless. <br>He gives freedom to the addicts. <br>He loves the unloved. <br>He accepts the outcasts. <br>He changes the unchangeable. <br>He forgives the unforgivable. <br>He accomplishes the impossible. <br>He saves sinners. <br>He seeks the lost. <br>He gives direction to the aimless. <br>He gives hope to the disillusioned. <br>He gives Truth to the confused. <br>He gives joy to the depressed. <br>He gives purpose to the purposeless. <br>He gives hope to the hopeless. <br>He redeems and He renews. <br>He touches and transforms. <br>He answers prayer."
2GfZl4kuVNI,"The only problem with Heat… is that I much prefer Michael Mann’s first film Thief, which has a lot of the same lessons on a smaller scale. But damn this movie is incredible"
2GfZl4kuVNI,I&#39;m 52 years old and yet I have never seen this film 😬
2GfZl4kuVNI,The shooting scene was 👌🏼😌
2GfZl4kuVNI,"The most epic trailer ever made and the greatest movie star 2 titans of the industry. All Pacino &amp; Robert De Niro, even they could not replicate the sheer epicness of this movie. The Diner scene where Pacino &amp; De Niro have their first onscreen showdown is the stuff of legend."
2GfZl4kuVNI,This trailer is confusing... Is this an action movie? a thriller? a romantic drama?
2GfZl4kuVNI,"27 years later and HEAT is still by far the greatest crime drama ever made! I have lost count on how many times I have seen movie! And the cast for this film is just spectacular! And to think that Michael Mann directed The Last of the Mohicans right before this, yet another one of my all time favorite films."
2GfZl4kuVNI,Literally greatest crime movie of all time
2GfZl4kuVNI,"I&#39;m going let y&#39;all finish, But Michael Mann you made one of the best crime movies of ALL TIME! ALL TIME!!! 🐐MVD! Moby your accompanying score &#39;God Moving Over the Face of the Waters&#39; from your 1995 Everything Is Wrong album flawlessly placed in the trailer and then again at the end of the film  Brilliantly Divine! 👏MVM!"
2GfZl4kuVNI,Maybe the best closing scene ever . Pacino holds a dying De Niro’s hand . The background music so magical. A Michael Mann masterpiece
2GfZl4kuVNI,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GfZl4kuVNI&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a> Is the scene with Neil counting the money in the film or even in the deleted scenes?"
2GfZl4kuVNI,I need 2 watch it
2GfZl4kuVNI,🔥🔥🔥
2GfZl4kuVNI,So Lucky to have seen this in the theatre
2GfZl4kuVNI,"S/o to Rick harris, Al Pacino, bob, and Natalie Portman!🤙"
2GfZl4kuVNI,I wish Donald and Khanyisa can see this film on video tape
2GfZl4kuVNI,Best movie of all time !!!!!
2GfZl4kuVNI,❤️❤️❤️
2GfZl4kuVNI,Chris said this was a love story. I guess.
2GfZl4kuVNI,"HEAT 2 needs to be made into Film, the book is coming out soon. Michael Mann, I hope you read this!"
2GfZl4kuVNI,Legendary...
2GfZl4kuVNI,"The two awesome actors of all time meet in this movie! I think this is the best action thriller movie form the 1990s! I still remember, when I have seen it in a movie theater! I heard back then from a friend, that one guy fell asleep during the movie! He woke up, when they left the bank and the shooting starts on the street! Some people in the offices on that street thought the shooting was real, because they were not informed!"
2GfZl4kuVNI,So cool of them to make a movie about the North Hollywood shootout before it even happened 🙌🏾
2GfZl4kuVNI,"My god, that is the most boring trailer of all time!<br>Thank god trailers are not like this anymore."
2GfZl4kuVNI,Stupendous film one of the best i’ve watched hands down!
2GfZl4kuVNI,In my top 5 movies ever
2GfZl4kuVNI,Almost the best film of the criminal genre!
2GfZl4kuVNI,My life changed after I saw this movie.
2GfZl4kuVNI,Very good movie cool
2GfZl4kuVNI,Robert de Niro and Al paccino are the greatest actors of all time.
2GfZl4kuVNI,♥️👑♥️♥️👑♥️👍
2GfZl4kuVNI,IMO the greatest movie ever made that didn&#39;t get any Oscar nominations.
2GfZl4kuVNI,"I loved this movie when I was younger because Pacino vs. De Niro, was like,&quot; King Kong vs. Godzilla.&quot;  I just had to see who won.  Such a classic, and so much better than the garbage produced nowadays."
2GfZl4kuVNI,"Heat movie is a classic with Robert Deniro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Mykelti Williamson, Dennis Haysbert. Robert and Al did another classic movie Righteous Kill with music rapper 50 Cent."
2GfZl4kuVNI,I watched this movie at least 40 times. Or 30 times for sure. And this still gives me goosebumps.
2GfZl4kuVNI,Awesome movie terrible trailer
2GfZl4kuVNI,o vosso pai
2GfZl4kuVNI,Even the trailer is on a GOAT level.
2GfZl4kuVNI,Outstanding movie..... What a masterpiece.. One of my top 5 movies..
2GfZl4kuVNI,مين جاي يشوف الفلم من سناب فايز 🙇🏻‍♀️؟
2GfZl4kuVNI,"Michael Mann Pudo Inquietarnos con esa escena emblemática. Maravillas del cine, una verdadera obra de arte..."
2GfZl4kuVNI,من طرف فايز بن جريس 🥰
2GfZl4kuVNI,Co stars to Michael Mann: you don’t have to pay me a salary Mr. Mann. I actually owe for giving me the opportunity to play a role of a lifetime. <br><br>Mr. Mann: you will play the dish washer on parole. You will have a total of 10 lines of dialogue.<br><br>Co- star to Mr. Mann: perfect! I won’t let you down sir.  To ensure I’m a master at my role and responsibilities I just obtained a part time job at IHOP washing dishes.
2GfZl4kuVNI,Hands down the greatest character based movie ever!
2GfZl4kuVNI,Gta v
2GfZl4kuVNI,"Best De Niro performance.<br>Everything about this movie is gold. I have watched a thousand movies, nothing was better."
2GfZl4kuVNI,"I wish it was 1995, in front of a cinema, buying a ticket and sit down and enjoy."
2GfZl4kuVNI,"it was an interesting movie until the crazy shooting. Those rifles never run out of ammo, and it was just so ridiculous that 30 cops could not take 3 thieves. I couldn&#39;t watch after that, it was too unrealistic. Too bad, because the acting was good as well as the cinematography and the rhythm of the film. But that stupid scene ruined it for me."
2GfZl4kuVNI,"Neil McCauley , the only villain who really just needed the money"
2GfZl4kuVNI,Saw this one with my dad in the theater. I was like 10. He freaked out when he first saw Al and Robert De Niro on one screen I remember. It took like 2hrs to happen but it was worth the hype. Then the shootout happened. Holy shit what a great scene. RIP Dad.
2GfZl4kuVNI,&quot;Told you I&#39;m never going back&quot;                            <br>no words can describe this movie .
2GfZl4kuVNI,Great movie but i prefer the ending was different.. Sometimes the villian gets to live
2GfZl4kuVNI,Unsung classic.
2GfZl4kuVNI,This is my favourite movie ever. I can rewatch it again and again
2GfZl4kuVNI,Greatest movie ever made
2GfZl4kuVNI,"The best movie of the 90s. And that&#39;s saying a lot. A lot.<br><br>The score of this film is also amazing. You had Moby, in his prime, you had Eric Clapton doing a tune, U2, Daniel Lanois. Amazing. Greatness personified."
2GfZl4kuVNI,Back in the day…when Hollywood did actually great movies
2GfZl4kuVNI,"Every time I watch the movie, I want Neil to get away in the end. Remember when he’s robbing the bank and tells people with heart issues they can lean against the wall? Three-dimensional characters."
2GfZl4kuVNI,Saw this film in the cinema in 95.<br>And still love it. <br>Arguably the greatest crime film ever made. <br>Nothing has come close to it in 26 years
2GfZl4kuVNI,I had the privilege to live my teenage back 90&#39;s... Besides it was a privilege It hurts thinking that you won&#39;t have that experience again...but it was good anyway..
2GfZl4kuVNI,the captain america civil war of the 90s

2GfZl4kuVNI,The beautiful brings sadness and beauty at the same time. Sighs good memories.
2GfZl4kuVNI,A masterpiece.
2GfZl4kuVNI,90s what an era!!! I think all of new generations need to watch the films of that time. The real cinema excitement before we knew such visual effects that kinda ruined our entertainment
2GfZl4kuVNI,There will never be another Heat. Period.

One more thing, the voice narration for this trailer was excellent. He has the perfect voice for movie trailers."

2GfZl4kuVNI,I saw the movie on the cinema and i have seen it many many times again since then

-C-xXZyX2zU,I love this movie! I consider it one of the two best Tom Sawyer movies along with Tom Sawyer 1973.
-C-xXZyX2zU,"I was a bartender in this movie,filmed in Huntsville,al."
-C-xXZyX2zU,"You know what I thought it was gonna be called, I thought it was gonna be called Tom and &quot;Jerry&quot;, but not even close. I guess it&#39;s only because it&#39;s not a game of cat and mouse from Turner Entertainment Company this time unless Tom Sawyer was named before that cat and also Huckleberry Finn was named before that Hound from Hanna-Barbera Productions a long time ago. 😁"
-C-xXZyX2zU,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-xXZyX2zU&amp;t=0m21s"">0:21</a> Becky looks like Boy George!"
-C-xXZyX2zU,"i was 4 - 5 years old when i saw this movie in theaters with my mother, it was the first live action movie i ever saw in theaters"
-C-xXZyX2zU,"R.I.P. Brad Renfro, Blake Heron, Charles Rocket, William Newman, Heath Lamberts and Marian Seldes."
-C-xXZyX2zU,Opening to the Aristocats on VHS
-C-xXZyX2zU,What a funny movie! Brad was awesome actor!!!

-C-xXZyX2zU,"What was the name of the music that was playing in the background in this Tom and Huck trailer video, hillaryannmarina?"
-C-xXZyX2zU,I was forced to watch this against my will
-C-xXZyX2zU,"The worst adaptation of Mark Twain&#39;s novel 2 ever come 2 the big screen, Elijah Wood&#39;s performance as Huckleberry Finn was more believable than Brad Renfro&#39;s"
-C-xXZyX2zU,Fuck Ms Cervi
-C-xXZyX2zU,"I remember seeing this film at My Summer Camp. And Yes, I did read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer at My Middle School as Part of The Start to Finish Book Series."
-C-xXZyX2zU,"his (brad&#39;s) spirit lives on.  just call to him.  eeh, this is just a witch&#39;s kind of thing, though."
-C-xXZyX2zU,There black man friend is missing from the film 
-C-xXZyX2zU,whos dead?
-C-xXZyX2zU,I had a huge crush on Brad Renfro in this movie.
-C-xXZyX2zU,"oh ok good, so i wasn&#39;t the only one who was very hormonal while watching this movie as a 7-year-old"
-C-xXZyX2zU,Injun Joe&#39;s on the move!
-C-xXZyX2zU,i remember having such a big crush on both of them when i was a kid &lt;3 good times!
-C-xXZyX2zU,Mark Twain must have rolled in his grave over this film. :(
-C-xXZyX2zU,im only doing this because i have to
-C-xXZyX2zU,Jonathan Taylor Thomas is awesome. 
-C-xXZyX2zU,its hard to believe but god bless you brad :&#39;((
-C-xXZyX2zU,"Um... he died in 2008... probably you didn&#39;t know about this, I guess?"
-C-xXZyX2zU,"WHAT?! he was like in his teens when this movie was made, and this movie was made in the 90&#39;s.  What happened?"
-C-xXZyX2zU,of literature that is
-C-xXZyX2zU,"I saw part of this movie, only a tiny amount.  And coincidentally I&#39;m reading the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in my english class."
-C-xXZyX2zU,agreed
-C-xXZyX2zU,0:54 Tom Sawyer got pwned!!!!!
-C-xXZyX2zU,"it&#39;s painful to watch this trailer in general
"
-C-xXZyX2zU,Brad Renfro... I miss u :&#39;(
-C-xXZyX2zU,Randy Taylor as Tom Sawyer? interesting....
-C-xXZyX2zU,@ 0:22 Holy shit it&#39;s Laney Boggs!
-C-xXZyX2zU,I always had a thing for huck when i watched this movie. Ahh those damn drugs! RIP
-C-xXZyX2zU,"@PanicSunday Yeah, just finished reading it and that&#39;s right on. Seems like Disney wanted to make Tom the loverboy type and Huck the rebel, when in reality they were a lot more a like and I&#39;d say Tom was more of the mastermind."
-C-xXZyX2zU,"&#39;hey becky&#39; *gets pushed off a bridge*
&#39;hey becky&#39; *gets punched in the face*

ah, l&#39;amour by donn hertzfeldt, much? ;)"
-C-xXZyX2zU,@FromtheWordsofBR Pretty much every Disney movie ive seen had no swearing in it
-C-xXZyX2zU,@coolstuff5673 There&#39;s only 3 uses of cusses!
-C-xXZyX2zU,"Is it me, or does this movie have a lot more killing and cursing then a regular disney movie"
-C-xXZyX2zU,"Cute movie.
But is it just me or should Huck &amp; Tom &#39;s personality switch cause how they act in this movie is nothing like they are in the book. I always see Tom as the one who is leader-like."
-C-xXZyX2zU,"Ya heroine at age 25, so sad."
-C-xXZyX2zU,"Oh my gosh, what happen to him?"
-C-xXZyX2zU,I&#39;ve been looking all over for this movie. So much better than that other one with elijah wood. And Jonathan is a cutie.
-C-xXZyX2zU,0:55 My favorite part :)
-C-xXZyX2zU,"&quot;Hey Becky&quot; [PUNCH!]
LMAO!"
-C-xXZyX2zU,@townsendgirlie Me neither it would be nostalgic!
-C-xXZyX2zU,&lt;3 this movie!
-C-xXZyX2zU,those were the days when i thought THIS movie was rebellious ;D
-C-xXZyX2zU,@Angelmickey32 Hell no! This movie&#39;s the best!
-C-xXZyX2zU,Hey! i remember this LOL!  but i was too little to see it &gt;.&lt;
-C-xXZyX2zU,"brad looks funny in this, i should see it!"
-C-xXZyX2zU,@SuperMetalmania666 ahahhahahahahaha love it.
-C-xXZyX2zU,"I was smart. I saw this movie before reading the actual books Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huck Finn. The movie didn&#39;t ruin the books, and i had the image of Brad Renfro in my mind rather than some country hick. Probably the reason why i enjoyed the books so much. "
-C-xXZyX2zU,The very beginning is funny too.
-C-xXZyX2zU,We saw this in English today. Huck is cute and fond of tripping Tom. 
-C-xXZyX2zU,"@TmSwyer: Ok, thanks for the explanation. I&#39;ve just read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer but I haven&#39;t seen any film based on the Twain&#39;s book. This trailer is the first time I see any ecranisation of his works,"
-C-xXZyX2zU,"@asmodeus585 Just completely personality wise.  Tom was no push over, Huck followed him as oppose to the other way around.  In this one they make Tom too adorable as opposed to his realistic, mischievous and romantic kid."
-C-xXZyX2zU,@TmSwyer: Do you mean their looks or the plot? &#39;Cause even in this trailer I see scenes that were descripted differently in the book. Becky would never hit Tom.
-C-xXZyX2zU,"I read Adventures of Huck Finn and I&#39;m in the middle of Tom Sawyer and I have to say, this trailer really makes them appear nothing like their book counter parts."
-C-xXZyX2zU,you have a point there.
-C-xXZyX2zU,"See this one&#39;s where Huck&#39;s actually the right age.... Not like the Elijah Wood one, where he&#39;s like 10...."
-C-xXZyX2zU,Engine joe reminds me of tenzin from uncharted 2
-C-xXZyX2zU,"yes i know that, passed away is the nicer way of saying that."
-C-xXZyX2zU,"No,He ODed on Heroin after being relesed from prison."
-C-xXZyX2zU,brad renfro passed away
-C-xXZyX2zU,i miss the 90s
-C-xXZyX2zU,"ohmygod, it&#39;s sooo upsetting to watch this and know that he&#39;s dead ):
He was truly good at what he accomplished though. 
Especially in this. (:

I had a HUGE crush on both of them when I was younger. aha"
-C-xXZyX2zU,i agree..elijah wood was awesome
-C-xXZyX2zU,old skool! I remember this came out when I was like 6 or 7
lcOqUE0u1LM,Probably the best Bond trailer I ever saw! This will make even the most cold blooded person wanna see it.

lcOqUE0u1LM,Wow that trailer gives away a pretty major spoiler and plot twist.
lcOqUE0u1LM,The audacity to put the twist in the trailer
lcOqUE0u1LM,"I remember when I was 14 and saw this on TV, I screamed and ran down to tell my dad Bond is back! What a great movie to bring back Bond."
lcOqUE0u1LM,Trailer kind of gives it away the whole 006 reveal.
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Such a fun fucking movie, one of the best Bond songs, very good cast, best video game tie-in, etc."
lcOqUE0u1LM,Hand not Ian Flaming but French Name France flag Ship 9min France <br>OR Yeux ou Oeil OR
lcOqUE0u1LM,I AM INVINCIBLEEEE
lcOqUE0u1LM,Then they went with Daniel Craig and hasn’t been anything since. Dude has a boring face and no acting skills. Terrible bond. Pierce was the best one since Connery
lcOqUE0u1LM,Best Bond movie ever.
lcOqUE0u1LM,I remember this movie. Brings back memories ✨
lcOqUE0u1LM,Post urss
lcOqUE0u1LM,"While Timothy Dalton was the closest to the character from the books, I think Pierce Brosnan was the best cinematic Bond: charming, smooth but still capable of intense action. &quot;Goldeneye&quot; was the movie that essentially saved the franchise and it was a HUGE deal back in &#39;95. &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; was a good enough follow-up. Too bad the later two flicks were so-so, but that wasn&#39;t Brosnan&#39;s fault. While I do like Daniel Craig as an actor, I am not fond of his Bond movies: the only one I liked was &quot;Skyfall&quot; and that one takes at least one hint from &quot;Goldeneye&quot; (the villain being a former, disfigured MI6 operative)."
lcOqUE0u1LM,I was hoping they wouldn&#39;t spoil the 006 twist but nah....ofc they did
lcOqUE0u1LM,Best 007 since Connery
lcOqUE0u1LM,Pierce Brosnan is definitely the best for 007.
lcOqUE0u1LM,Still the best James Bond and the best James Bond film. At least he didn&#39;t fucking die.. or have a daughter
lcOqUE0u1LM,"I&#39;ve seen every single Bond film and would definitely say this is one of the BEST of the whole lot. I have a few other favourites as well, but Goldeneye was right up there. Brosnan was a brilliant 007. Everyone goes on about Connery, but Brosnan embodied that character better imho. The issue I have with this trailer is that it gives too much away!!"
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Watch theme at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcOqUE0u1LM&amp;t=2m34s"">2:34</a> ❤️"
lcOqUE0u1LM,Best bond . Love bond
lcOqUE0u1LM,If he is the most famous secret agent ... then he is doing a very poor job at being a secret agent XD
lcOqUE0u1LM,No way we&#39;d have a trailer like this come out post 2020
lcOqUE0u1LM,Kind of sad that more people talk about the N64 game than the movie it was based on.
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Izabella Scorupco is one of the most beautiful women ever in this film as Natalya.  She looks so cute as a brunette and while she&#39;s got a bikini body, the skirt and sweater outfit with the stockings in this are adorable.  And the beach piece she wears with the bikini is amazing.. not trampy but respectable.. Gorgeous gorgeous lady."
lcOqUE0u1LM,So much about this movie is perfect
lcOqUE0u1LM,for me &quot;Pierce Brosan&quot; is the super hero james bond
lcOqUE0u1LM,Slappers Only!
lcOqUE0u1LM,Half of everything is luck...
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Pierce Brosan was the first actor who played the role of James Bond 007. After watching Goldeneye, the world is not enough, Tomorrow never dies, Die another Day. I realized that he did an excellent job. And learned how he charmed beautiful young women. Ever since I watched him in action, I learned the moves from him and charmed any beautiful young woman."
lcOqUE0u1LM,I was disappointed that they didn’t have the zip line on the belt in the video game.  Still good times though.
lcOqUE0u1LM,Too much  spoilers
lcOqUE0u1LM,"i hate trailers so goddamn much, this spoils the entire movie"
lcOqUE0u1LM,Nintendo64「007ゴールデンアイ」をプレイしたのきっかけでこの映画を見ることになった
lcOqUE0u1LM,Im glad i have never seen this trailer before watching the movie.<br><br>Btw best bond ever
lcOqUE0u1LM,Brosnan was the best bond
lcOqUE0u1LM,Best 007 film.
lcOqUE0u1LM,"My favorite Bond film with Brosnan as 007. Natalya is awesome mmm,mmm,mmm!!!"
lcOqUE0u1LM,Jean Grey and Nightcrawler!!
lcOqUE0u1LM,Best video game adaptation ever
lcOqUE0u1LM,Just dropping by after watching Brosnan play Goldeneye 64 with Fallon. They really gave away the whole movie in these trailers back then 😂
lcOqUE0u1LM,"I just watched no time to die, they don&#39;t make movies like goldeneye and casino royale anymore"
lcOqUE0u1LM,I just don’t understand the explosions . Like why would that antenna explode like it was storing fuel or something. Too many .
lcOqUE0u1LM,This is from the time where Bond was still about having fun... Today it’s mostly ideology and morals... Like a boring school teacher...
lcOqUE0u1LM,If this is the trailer they originally released then it bloody spoils the beginning of the movie when 006 fakes his death.<br><br>    It says that 006 will be his nemesis yet the movie tries to fool us into thinking he’s dead.
lcOqUE0u1LM,N64
lcOqUE0u1LM,This trailer was horrible
lcOqUE0u1LM,Every Bond is has their place cemented in filmmaking history!
lcOqUE0u1LM,Plot twist: his full name is actually Bond James Bond.
lcOqUE0u1LM,"why the hell did they spoil the main and biggest plot twist in the movie!? <br><br>I watched it recently for the first time and was quote surprised that 006 was alive and, in fact, the main villain.<br><br>I notice that this was quite prevalent some years ago - that the trailers actually reval the plot and all the unexpectes surprises."
lcOqUE0u1LM,ME ENCANTÓ
lcOqUE0u1LM,That voiceover ruins the whole thing.
lcOqUE0u1LM,006 vs 007. Every the good bond won! 😁 ❤️
lcOqUE0u1LM,Famous secret agent. That&#39;s an oxymoron if I&#39;ve ever heard one.
lcOqUE0u1LM,It&#39;s still one of the best James Bond movies.
lcOqUE0u1LM,Vim pelo app Mega HD Filmes
lcOqUE0u1LM,the trailer makes it seem like a fast paced action movie but the actual movie is soooo damn slow and boring... I love the N64 game but the movie is SOOO DAMN boring and horrible pace... didn&#39;t age well at all
lcOqUE0u1LM,That is such a badass movie
lcOqUE0u1LM,Best bond film to date
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Thank goodness I watched the film before watching any of the trailers. That Bond villain twist reveal in the trailer would’ve spoiled the movie for me if I watched it before the movie. I honestly did not see the twist coming when I first watched this film. The trailer doesn’t do the movie justice and ruins what could have been a great plot twist. Anyways, this is such a great movie. So far my favorite James Bond film. I never had the chance to watch it as a kid, despite playing the video game of it on the Nintendo 64 (but only the multiplayer, not the story mode) in my next-door neighbor’s house with him and my brother. I first watched this film last October on my computer for free."
lcOqUE0u1LM,This is and will always be THE James Bond.
lcOqUE0u1LM,A masterpiece!
lcOqUE0u1LM,This is so 90s.
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Movie trailers were so shit back in the day. Today&#39;s are much better, strangely, the movies are much worse."
lcOqUE0u1LM,I didn&#39;t ask for your middle name Bond Bond
lcOqUE0u1LM,This movie is right after Licence To Kill.
lcOqUE0u1LM,This trailer shows just how unsophisticated they were in those days. No teasing about the villain&#39;s identity or the plot. They even provide a trimmed down version of the show-stopping dam stunt from the pre-title sequence that fails to convey what an amazing stunt it was.
lcOqUE0u1LM,&quot;You are like boys with toys&quot;<br><b>*cut to huge tank breaking through a concrete wall*</b><br><br>Ah yes these filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Was the explosion in Nashville on Christmas Day 2020 caused by an EMP? Walt Whiteman thinks so. <a href=""https://waltwhitemansworld.blogspot.com/2020/12/some-awkward-questions-about-nashville.html"">https://waltwhitemansworld.blogspot.com/2020/12/some-awkward-questions-about-nashville.html</a>"
lcOqUE0u1LM,From the opening to Stargate (1995) VHS.
lcOqUE0u1LM,&quot;I AM INVINCIBLE!&quot;
lcOqUE0u1LM,très stupide film pour des cons!
lcOqUE0u1LM,"James Bond, 90s style! 😎"
lcOqUE0u1LM,"oh wow they spoiled it, when I watched the movie I never knew the whole time so it was actually suprising."
lcOqUE0u1LM,The best Bond ever!!! My favorite action film.
lcOqUE0u1LM,The best bond film
lcOqUE0u1LM,Never took to Brosnan as Bond. Looked more like a concierge at a 5 star hotel than a deadly 00 agent.  Or a guy who could get you that Jaguar in the colour you wanted faster than other dealers..
lcOqUE0u1LM,<b>Pierce Brosnan: </b><b><i>The James Bond-iest James Bond Ever?!</i></b>
lcOqUE0u1LM,Spoiler (without seeing the movie) - Sean bean dies....
lcOqUE0u1LM,"I was 14, discovering the flavours of life, unaware of the corruption and deceit outside cantonment zone, it came two years after the insurgency ended in Punjab and six years after the USSR collapsed (I read many of their works as a kid and as a teenager from classical writings to Cyberpunk), it was the first 007 movie in a very long time, the first in my era of partial control over myself. I can watch it a 100 times. I don&#39;t even like UK or their crazy inhuman agencies. That was the era when I was really myself - indulge, free, athletic and a budding zealous bright individual."
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Just love that little clip of music at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcOqUE0u1LM&amp;t=2m33s"">2:33</a> - encapsulates Bond."
lcOqUE0u1LM,Now its time to go get betrayed!!
lcOqUE0u1LM,And the most exciting parts were not even the violence!
lcOqUE0u1LM,1:48 PM 12/8/2019  Did they do it for this one too?  I can relate to some scenes in this.  Just thinking to myself again is all.  My adoption family is Volga German (Russians migrating through Germany or Poland).  Kind of same drama with what 006 is going through being Russian in movie but working for British Govt.  007 is me NOW is how I relate to this movie.  I found out about the Royal House of Windsor.
lcOqUE0u1LM,🍸 GOLDEN EYE 📡 Bronson best bond movie.👌
lcOqUE0u1LM,Great Bond movie and great meta movie.
lcOqUE0u1LM,BMW Z3 ON FIRE! MY CAR!
lcOqUE0u1LM,"It was a great comeback for Bond, and the best outing since 1981. And it gave us one of the greatest videogames of all time."
lcOqUE0u1LM,Still the best Bond film ever imo.
lcOqUE0u1LM,We say report
lcOqUE0u1LM,The dreaded circular run
lcOqUE0u1LM,Incell
lcOqUE0u1LM,funny how old trailers spoil all the movie but no one complained
lcOqUE0u1LM,This trailer itself just gave out the entire movie including the villain 006 which was suppose to be a twist in the movie. Huge spoiler!
lcOqUE0u1LM,Yo llegue acá por el video juego ._.
lcOqUE0u1LM,WTF a lot of fucking spoilers...<br>but not at all if you played the videogame :D
lcOqUE0u1LM,This trailer tells half the movie. :D
lcOqUE0u1LM,"Not a big Bond fan, this movie is legit though. Pierce Brosnan was the right guy to play Bond, and Martin Campbell&#39;s directing is strong. Famke Janssen is the best looking thing ever seen in a James Bond film. The action is well done and it has a great 90&#39;s feel."
UrC75wUKoFM,"Over the last four years, I have often thought about this movie - or watched it - when I wanted to remember what a President of the United States should be like. Those ideas have grown since the January 6 2021 riot and attempted coup at the Capitol."
tVdn8JH91Dg,"The last line in the trailer with Dracula was cut, sadly."
tVdn8JH91Dg,this movie is hilarious

dO2LWKpeyI8,"He won the world, he lost his own nation."
dO2LWKpeyI8,2024 biden  the movie by oliver stone lol
dO2LWKpeyI8,They hate trump show much biden is tge real dirtbags
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Superb film, get the director&#39;s cut with Sam Waterston added back in."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Had to dislike video too many f_cking ads a_shole!
dO2LWKpeyI8,soundtrack written by john williams :o
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Forgot Martha MITCHELL  in this story, it appears"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Amazing actor. He doesn&#39;t even try to impersonate Nixon or sound just like him and yet you believe he really is Nixon.
dO2LWKpeyI8,first time i&#39;ve heard anthony hopkins doing american accent...it&#39;s refreshing 🥰
dO2LWKpeyI8,Anthony Hopkins the best actor of our time * 100% of his abilities to duplicate the character Hopkins saturate himself to become * There is no other actor that can portray that naturally *
dO2LWKpeyI8,Superb trailer
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Great movie, but like the movie, the trailer was a little too long."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Joe Biden has a little bit of Richard Nixon in him. <br><br>Nixon may have left a little bit of descendent taste, descendant message to Biden. <br><br>President Richard Nixon called on than Senator-elect Joe Biden December 19, 1972 to check on Biden family and congratulating Joe Biden for winning Delaware Senate seat. <br><br>Richard Nixon and Joe Biden both come from hardscrabble families."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"The only reason why watched Oliver Stone Nixion, because of Anthony Hopkins and Larry hangman."
dO2LWKpeyI8,The guy was a lousy crook.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Director&#39;s Cut version is the best, unfortunately Stone had to delete the Helms scene because helms made a Threat to sue Stone."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I visited President Nixon’s Presidential Library In 2008. It was a beautiful setting. In 1972 I was a McGovern supporter, but after visiting the library, I came away with new respect for President Nixon."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Wonder if a Trump film is in the works - many differences; yes Nixon ended the Vietnam war; overhauled many government agencies and created a few more like EPA and US Postal Service.  But Trump paralleled Nixon in meeting with North Korea&#39;s Kim Jong-Un like Nixon&#39;s meeting with Chinese PRC chairman Mao Zedong as no previous US President would consider.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Anthony Hopkins was way more scarier as Nixon than he was as Hannibal Lector.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"This, JFK, and Platoon = my fave Oliver Stone films."
dO2LWKpeyI8,i cant help but feel like if someone was to make a movie about trump as president it would be it would be way more dramatic and insane then this.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Nixon was the president of the United States. Of the United States. He was president of the United States. He was President. Of the United States. He was the president of the United States of America. Nixon was. Richard Nixon was the president of the United States of America.
dO2LWKpeyI8,When epic movies had epic trailers.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"God, it&#39;s so weird to think that this movie is technically a Disney film. And it was so controversial for the way it depicted Richard Nixon&#39;s life, that Walt Disney&#39;s daughter actually had to write a letter to The Nixon family, disapproving the movie."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I remember being in a mostly empty theater and seeing this <a href=""http://trailer.at/"">trailer.At</a> the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2LWKpeyI8&amp;t=4m14s"">4:14</a> mark,some guy across from me let out one of the biggest laughs I have ever heard in my life."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Still one of the best film trailers I’ve ever seen.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Love this movie ! Powers Boothe was great as Alexander Haig .
dO2LWKpeyI8,For Both Donald J Trump and Rodrigo Duterte Losing and Sacrificing Their Life  to World Spies Jerks Bastards Beauties......
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I love this film. A classic. Hopkins performance mesmerising. Simply one of the greatest political biopics of cinema history. Other viewers​ may disagree but Nixon is not simply portrayed as some kind of political bogeyman, there are variations of light and darkness here concerning Richard Nixon. As with any human being. That makes it a deep, thoughtful film. May I recommend Frost/Nixon as another excellent film."
dO2LWKpeyI8,This was one of Anthony Hopkins best performances.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I think Hopkins was a little miscast here. He never really gets the very characteristic voice patherns of Nixon, that deep growl."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Complete agreement with the summary of this videa
dO2LWKpeyI8,I don&#39;t believe that Pat Nixon ever raised her voice in her life.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Trump will get a movie like this xD
dO2LWKpeyI8,We all know Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor.  However his accent in this is TERRIBLE!!!  I hear too much of his British accent coming in and out.  I wish they would have used an American actor to play Nixon.
dO2LWKpeyI8,God bless Richard Nixon 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🐘🐘🐘🐘
dO2LWKpeyI8,Im glad that i have this movie On Dvd  .. amazing movie  ❗
dO2LWKpeyI8,i have been to Nixon museum   half of the visitors are from Mainland China.    Nixon was to us the Horatio  Alger of the late 1960&#39;s.
dO2LWKpeyI8,lol James Woods became his character in real life
dO2LWKpeyI8,"What a Trailer, they don&#39;t make them like that anymore."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I wonder what kind of job Al Pacino might have done, playing Nixon as a kind of Mob Boss, which is what he basically was. Imagine Nixon as Tony Montana ..There doesn&#39;t have to be an exact physical resemblance, and the hint of Hannibal Lecter in the portrayal works well, but imo it is impossible to suspend disbelief that we are watching Nixon on the screen instead of Anthony Hopkins. His performance is all in the VOICE and makeup. It&#39;s like watching 2 hours of bad screen test."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"OKAY, I&#39;m not normally a fan of Oliver Stone but this one just blew me away after watched it using boxxy software. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn&#39;t that how life seems to be at times as well?"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Why did they pick Anthony Hopkins to be Nixon, personly I think he doesn&#39;t look much like him at all."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Nixon was amazing. The elite wanted him out like JFK. He was a great American.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I&#39;m binge watching &quot;The Post&quot; (2018), &quot;All the President&#39;s Men&quot;<br>(1976) and &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995) at the moment.  A nostalgic trip down memory lane..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Nixon&#39;s worst mistake was to open China and give communism a gate for the 21st century. Other than that, leftists would be buried with old Soviet Union. The final speech is amazing! Great movie!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Do you really want this dick ?
dO2LWKpeyI8,Do you really want this dick?
dO2LWKpeyI8,That&#39;s one long trailer. But it looks like a good movie :-)
dO2LWKpeyI8,What a great performance<br> by Hopkins!!!!
dO2LWKpeyI8,I watch this every night. Love the last line in the trailer.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Stone&#39;s best film, I reckon. Brilliant."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Amazing trailer for one of my all time favorite movies!!!!
dO2LWKpeyI8,I don/t like Oliver&#39;s tone.
dO2LWKpeyI8,Every goddamn awesome john williams&#39;score reminds me to Star Wars
dO2LWKpeyI8,"&quot;When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are.&quot; That is a line you use to seal the deal with a trailer."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"JR Ewing at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2LWKpeyI8&amp;t=2m40s"">2:40</a>"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Ah, the days before movie trailers had to fade/in out between every transition."
dO2LWKpeyI8,I didn&#39;t know Niles Crane served on the Nixon Administration staff.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Hannibal Lecter?  Aw, give me a fuckin&#39; break, for god sakes."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I&#39;m sorry, i can&#39;t get past the casting of Anthony Hopkins- he looks and sounds NOTHING like Nixon."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Great movie and I consider it Oliver Stone&#39;s best.  But why is the trailer 4.5 minutes?
dO2LWKpeyI8,This guy is a true idiot. Ignoring him might be the best thing one can do...
dO2LWKpeyI8,"You pseudo-expert called Williams a &quot;plagiarist hack&quot;. That alone tells me that you have no clue what you&#39;re talking or writing about. You pretend to have a clue about whatever you think it is, but you actually don&#39;t know shit. And again: it has nothing to do with hearing music differently. It has something to do with having a taste in music or not. And you pal, are missing that taste. There&#39;s no accounting for taste, because you don&#39;t have any. That&#39;s why we should end this &quot;conversation&quot;..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"You seem to be unable to understand what I was writing you in my previous comment. Don&#39;t know what&#39;s so hard about that. Anyway, you&#39;re still wrong about what you wrote. Has nothing to do with hearing, but rather something with understanding. And you definitely didn&#39;t understand a bit..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"You neither have a good taste in music, nor do you have the clue what you&#39;re talking about in the first place. This track is called &quot;The 1960s: The Turbulent Years&quot; and is played when dramatic events during this period of time are shown in &quot;Nixon&quot;, e.g. the assassination of Martin Luther King, the war in Vietnam and so on. You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, idiot..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Dramatically inappropriate? It&#39;s an operatic score for an operatic film, and one of his most rousing works. It does wonders for the film.

Who is he plagiarising here? Support your libellous claims. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,Anthony Hopkins gives a superb performance as the sweaty unscrupulous Nixon.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Ironically, the bombing of Cambodia was actually the most serious of the charges and yet now is completely forgotten - presidents bomb without the country&#39;s approval as a matter of routine now."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"lol, indeed. at 1:28"
dO2LWKpeyI8,I think this one is better than JFK
dO2LWKpeyI8,Frank Langella couldn&#39;t shine Hopkins boots. The overacting in Frost Nixon is not the worse thing about the movie. It doesn&#39;t depict Nixon or the interview well at all. It&#39;s about like watching Oliver Stone&#39;s version of what happened.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"j&#39;espere qu&#39;il est aussi bien que JFK........je l&#39;ai en dvd mais pas encore vu......un casting de fou (hopkins, woods, boothe, hoskins, harris, walsh...)"
dO2LWKpeyI8,irs obama-gate
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I&#39;m a big fan of this film but I think it would have worked better without the flashbacks to Nixon&#39;s childhood or even the flashbacks from the Eisenhower era and the 1960 and 1962 elections. Most of the information you get from these segments is unnecessary and/or explored in dialogue that takes place elsewhere in the movie. Plus, it&#39;s impossible to make Hopkins look like the younger Nixon. I would have kept the focus mainly on Nixon&#39;s presidency and the events of Watergate. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,"The movie&#39;s a bit of a mess, but the cast is AMAZING!!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Could anybody explain to me why the movie involved little to no interaction with either of Nixons Vice-Presidents: Spiro Agnew or Gerald Ford. The movie makes it seem like they never interacted, Im sure neither had anything to do with Watergate but with Cabinet meetings, and advisor meetings something should have been thrown. Unless Stone couldn&#39;t find a good actor to play them. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,"what a great trailer
"
dO2LWKpeyI8,larry hagmans character never existed in real life 
dO2LWKpeyI8,Nixon- Real life macbeth
dO2LWKpeyI8,This is easily the best politico movie I&#39;ve ever seen.  It is high drama and an incredible tragedy.  
dO2LWKpeyI8,"hopkins was astonishing in this movie...brilliant biopic by oliver stone,one of his greatest along with jfk..."
dO2LWKpeyI8,That actor who played nixon was a clone to an nbc reporter during the 61&#39; debate.
dO2LWKpeyI8,WTF are you insane. The Doors was superb.  The Doors was a million zillion times better than this.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Yes, and the people of Cambodia miss him too.   :L   A**hole!!!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Hahahaha...Are you being sarcastic dude?  The trailer but me to sleep, nevermind 3hours and 10 minutes of the actual movie."
dO2LWKpeyI8,Awesome trailer.  Makes you want to rush out and see the movie right away.
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Those were different times.  Cold war, Pre internet and internet trolling, Demonstrations meant something, Wall Street wasn&#39;t the megalithic beast it is today.  Every decade has immensity to it, and we decide where we fit into those decades.  A great adventure is underway."
dO2LWKpeyI8,I&#39;m not really an admirer of Stone. I mean The Doors was embarrasingly poor. However Nixon is a solid effort
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I agree that its a masterpiece and is Oliver stones best, and I mostly agree with you ( exept the fact that its the greatest movie of all time, I say Schindlers list is) I love how the film made Nixon look like a bad person but still made him very sympethetic, Hopkin achieves as Richard Nixon. found it to be kinda simular &quot;Shakespeares Juleas Ceaser&quot; and &quot;Citizen Cane"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Excellent movie!!!!!
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I love this movie. I grew up poor and became very successful (like Nixon). I understand Nixon. He loved America. Unlike Obama, Nixon really cared about America!!"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"I hate the film trailers, because somo of the pictures was removed later on the final movie"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen and Paul Sorvino have NEVER been BETTER in a movie -- period!!  :)"
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Wow, long trailer. Anyway, Hannibal as Nixon? Who knew....."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Stone&#39;s movies are always 50/50. 50% accurate (brilliantly) and 50% fictional (brilliantly). This movie is OK, but Hopkins&#39; accent is to present. "
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Hopkins sure makes a fat, rotund Nixon."
dO2LWKpeyI8,"Of all actors who played Nixon, Hopkins captured the essence of Nixon the best.

(and he&#39;s not even American...now THAT is an actor)"
dO2LWKpeyI8,Classic?   Are you kidding?
dO2LWKpeyI8,RIC YOUNG is best of MAO!!
EJXDMwGWhoA,The trailer is a little bit misleading.
EJXDMwGWhoA,I love so many scenes in the trailer were not in the movie. Makes me want to see what they were all about.
EJXDMwGWhoA,Having a sociopath as a friend and keeper and a wife who&#39;s a borderline is probably not going to work out well.
EJXDMwGWhoA,Que grande clássico
EJXDMwGWhoA,Read many books on the history of Vegas. One thing few people notice is how Scorsese is on the side of the Wise Guys. These people were so terrifyingly monstrous - if truly shown from the perspective of their victims.... no one could bare to watch this film.
EJXDMwGWhoA,20 years in the can
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Anyone see the deleted scene? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJXDMwGWhoA&amp;t=1m32s"">1:32</a>. Seen this movie a thousand times and that scene is not in it."
EJXDMwGWhoA,"When a woman says &quot;you&#39;ve got the wrong girl&quot;, listen, then move on."
EJXDMwGWhoA,Boss use of ‘Gimme Shelter’
EJXDMwGWhoA,👍👍👍
EJXDMwGWhoA,I&#39;ve never stepped foot into a casino unless it was for an interview
EJXDMwGWhoA,film trailer<br>Casino<br>🤟🤟
EJXDMwGWhoA,"This is, for me, one the top 5 Martin Scorsese movies. De Niro, Pesci and Stone gave a great performance, the script is amazing (fantastic dialogues), perfect editing, a masterful photography with incredibles 70&#39;s/80&#39;s colors and a soundtrack filled with Rolling Stones, blues, Devo and many other top artists. 11/10."
EJXDMwGWhoA,"This movie just wow...the fashion, the lighting, the setting, the music and oh the complex characters n script...just everything. I also thought that this movie has the same tempo as Goodfellas"
EJXDMwGWhoA,"I’m 1/3 of the way through this film and they’ve played about 100 songs. Kinda a cheap and uninspired way to make a movie. And they call scorsese a genius??? And the narration parts seem lame too. Idk, i’ll finish it but so far its getting a D grade from me. Overrated."
EJXDMwGWhoA,The gangster trilogy <br>Goodfellas<br>Casino<br>The irishman
EJXDMwGWhoA,You dont get better than this 👌.
EJXDMwGWhoA,Is this movie good someone told me I need to watch it?
EJXDMwGWhoA,Money
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Scorsese gosta de fazer filmes que possuam dinheiro envolvido, e eu gosto de dinheiro"
EJXDMwGWhoA,Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are the most underrated duo in movie history.
EJXDMwGWhoA,They had it all. They ran the show. And it was paradise on Earth. While it lasted...<br><br>ROBERT DENIRO<br>SHARON STONE<br>JOE PESCI<br><br>A MARTIN SCORSESE PICTURE<br><br>CASINO<br><br>COMING SOON FROM UNIVERSAL PICTURES
EJXDMwGWhoA,In the gangster movie genre this one is underrated IMO.
EJXDMwGWhoA,Rolling Stones are the eargasm for Scorsese’s cinegasm
EJXDMwGWhoA,God Bless you Martin Scoresse!<br>One of my favorite movies!
EJXDMwGWhoA,And lie and lie of their&#39;s less intelligence.. And because they are one of  Al Kaida..
EJXDMwGWhoA,"ONLY what they want: Kill me!  That they have more Money for casino&#39;s, gun&#39;s,industry- children&#39;s por*, steeling idea&#39;s to be criminal&#39;s..."
EJXDMwGWhoA,Because FBi and CIA sale mine&#39;s Picture&#39;s of das with alkaida that they can have more Money to giving inside to casino and sale Real time&#39;s or giving away fór play. Also giving me Something to drink that I can&#39;t good eating And look&#39;s like a pregnant..  barmaid was fuc*King With Them and Boss of Casino Is criminal and one of alkaida hading criminal&#39;s... All in Czech Republic supported of criminal&#39;s policie And policie and cobra.
EJXDMwGWhoA,.
EJXDMwGWhoA,Yeah it’s a good movie but I thought it was extremely over rated
EJXDMwGWhoA,wow that was epic l saw the movie
EJXDMwGWhoA,I&#39;m just here because casino is my favorite mob  movie after Goodfellas I always thought Martin scorsese made the best mob movies  Robert Deniro  and Joe  pesci are always Amazing together and Sharon stone was also incredible
EJXDMwGWhoA,They dont make great movies like this anymore. Nowadays the films are awful crap and boring
EJXDMwGWhoA,Why casino is slightly better than Goodfelles... because most people believe its about the mafia... its about the Chicago Outfit... they ran vegas
EJXDMwGWhoA,Casino <br>Film trailer <br>Director  Martin Scorsese <br>Con <br>Sharon Stone<br>Robert De Niro <br>Joe Pesci <br>John Wayne
EJXDMwGWhoA,Casino &gt; Goodfellas? Maybe…
EJXDMwGWhoA,روبرت دينيرو :  فعلا ؛  ليس من السهل العمل في الكازينو
EJXDMwGWhoA,Why trailers make the movie seem so awful?
EJXDMwGWhoA,Scorsese just knows how to do mob films... goodfellas the Italian mob... casino the Chicago outfit.... the only modern film ive seen that comes close is Donny Brasco
EJXDMwGWhoA,Fantastic mind blowing movie ever....wow
EJXDMwGWhoA,Great
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Weird that it&#39;s no longer on Netflix and even weirder that it&#39;s not on amazon prime, either free or to purchase!?!<br> There are ways to watch it though, dont need to search to hard as well🤪"
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Girl: You don’t know me. You got the wrong girl..<br>Deniro: Youll be set for the rest of your life<br>Girl: You know me so well, lets get married!"
EJXDMwGWhoA,"I was 3 when this was acted and turned 30 this January. However, I only saw this on a movie channel yesterday and immediately could tell it had an 80s or 90s feel to it. I love watching stuff from the era of my childhood. And by the way, it was a very interesting movie though the part where they murdered Nicky and his friend in the cornfield made me retch."
EJXDMwGWhoA,Casino 🎰 (1995) is Rated R in red.
EJXDMwGWhoA,🚬🚬🚬🚬🚬🚬🚬♥️🚬🚬🚬🚬🚬🚬🚬
EJXDMwGWhoA,I&#39;m here because of Maddy&#39;s coat
EJXDMwGWhoA,I mean.. how often is the jewish guy the hero of these types of flicks? Better than Goodfellas
EJXDMwGWhoA,Timeless classic 👌
EJXDMwGWhoA,God Bless you from Lucifer. He&#39;s really nice!
EJXDMwGWhoA,Ops
EJXDMwGWhoA,"I hate to say this but Robert De niro in this movie was just Robert Deniro. He sounds and acts like some one from 1950s Little Italy NYC, not a Jewish guy from Chicago."
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Martin Scorsese , Robert DeNiro and Joey Pepsico , one of the greatest trio"
EJXDMwGWhoA,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJXDMwGWhoA&amp;t=1m16s"">1:16</a>"
EJXDMwGWhoA,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJXDMwGWhoA&amp;t=2m14s"">2:14</a>"
EJXDMwGWhoA,Que vídeo profissional show demais.
EJXDMwGWhoA,"<b>&quot;Casino&quot;</b> is One of my all-time Favorite Movies, I still watch it to this day. <b>&quot;Good Fellas&quot;</b> was Good also. <i>Nicky</i> actually thought <i>Sam</i> only existed out there because of him, but it was the other way around. They did not wack him sooner because of Sam. Nicky the short guy with the Ego found out in the end though. He was a loose cannon."
EJXDMwGWhoA,I absolutely love the part in this trailer where the music changes to ‘Gimme Shelter’ and he says “They found a guy’s head in the desert.”
EJXDMwGWhoA,26 YEARS ♥
EJXDMwGWhoA,De Niro!
EJXDMwGWhoA,Great trailer
EJXDMwGWhoA,&quot; you existe because of me..&quot;
EJXDMwGWhoA,Casino is a 1995 Martin Scorsese Movie by Universal.
EJXDMwGWhoA,That movie more brutalllllll
EJXDMwGWhoA,Viva  Las Vegas
EJXDMwGWhoA,Nothing hits quite like the Godfather
EJXDMwGWhoA,What&#39;s that song in the end?
EJXDMwGWhoA,“I have to be able to trust you with my life. Can I trust you? CAN I TRUST YOU.”
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Movie with most words spoken in a history - 67,678<br>Second is JFK with 58,832"
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Why I’ve never watched this movie I’ll never know. I like Sharon stone, I like Joe Pesci, I like Robert DeNiro. Plus Martin Scorsese has made some good movies. I think now I will watch my DVD of it!!! It looks good"
EJXDMwGWhoA,What song is it playing into the Background... Seems like it also plays during the Intro of &#39;The Departed&#39;
EJXDMwGWhoA,One of the best movies ever made.
EJXDMwGWhoA,I saw this movie move than 100 times😎best ever🥰
EJXDMwGWhoA,I went on after this making a lot of bad comedy’s and I made a lot of money doing them and that’s that
EJXDMwGWhoA,Great pic
EJXDMwGWhoA,"This movie came out during American 🇺🇸 Thanksgiving of 1995, the same time as Nick of Time with Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken and Toy Story"
EJXDMwGWhoA,&quot;You only exist out here because of ME&quot;<br>I love that Joe Pesci &quot;ME!&quot; that i love to rewind that scene over again!
EJXDMwGWhoA,The lights and noise not Random by any means u feel like a jackpot winner now? No natural light that&#39;s why my spirit couldn&#39;t handle it
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Sad movie, Brilliant but truly heartbreaking, this is a film that certainly does not glorify the violence of the mafia"
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Does anyone know about the scene at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJXDMwGWhoA&amp;t=2m03s"">2:03</a>? It wasn’t in the film"
EJXDMwGWhoA,CASINO
EJXDMwGWhoA,Movies don&#39;t get any better than this
EJXDMwGWhoA,<b>Dogecoin to the moon</b> 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
EJXDMwGWhoA,What is the name of the first song ?
EJXDMwGWhoA,After watching this movie I thought Joe pesci should have won Oscar for this movie
EJXDMwGWhoA,When I started watching movies of these 3 legends with this legendary director Martin Scorsese the Irishman was first I got in my watchlist but I will watch it in end after all the movies of de Niro and Martin Scorsese had done already watched al pacino
EJXDMwGWhoA,"I seriously wonder why people like this movie. It&#39;s just four hours of ugly people doing ugly, horrible things to other ugly people in an ugly movie. I cannot think of anything in it that was entertaining in any way whatsoever."
EJXDMwGWhoA,"Best Mafia Movie Ever Made, even Better than the Godfather,I enjoyed this Movie so Much I didn&#39;t even feel the 2h 55m it Took"
EJXDMwGWhoA,❤️🌹
EJXDMwGWhoA,The Weeknd brought me here
EJXDMwGWhoA,If I run into people that hasn&#39;t seen this and Goodfellas i think what the hell rock you been living under
EJXDMwGWhoA,<b>They had it all</b><br><b>They ran the show</b><br><b>And it was paradise... While it lasted</b>
EJXDMwGWhoA,Sharon told her movie daughter to antagonize James during those scenes to upset him .
EJXDMwGWhoA,Love this movie.  Ginger had it made n ruined it with a child that she traumatized
EJXDMwGWhoA,I remember watching this trailer in the cinema and being very impressed. Not one single second wasted. The film is an underrated masterpiece. I doubt we&#39;ll see a movie like this again.
EJXDMwGWhoA,ONE OF MY FAVOURITE HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR MARTIN SCORSESE.
EJXDMwGWhoA,The greatest influence on the Weeknd&#39;s latest album. ♥️
EJXDMwGWhoA,S
EJXDMwGWhoA,Best film in history😝
EJXDMwGWhoA,"I Wonder if Martin Scorsese have a grudge again Joe Pesci, because he is always dying in his movies, he can&#39;t seen to be able to make it out alive."
DfqPjRMsRP0,It’s my favorite movie 🎥

DfqPjRMsRP0,Excellent. ♡ T.E.N.
DfqPjRMsRP0,This movie makes me laugh so hard Jim Carrey is the King of Comedy 😂😄
yNLaTtpovys,Movies like this got over-rated because of the actors involved.  I couldn&#39;t really get into this back in the days and looking at this  trailer tells me why.  No sense of direction at all in this &quot;chit.&quot;
yNLaTtpovys,Masterpiece.
yNLaTtpovys,RIP sammy wilson 1934 2022
yNLaTtpovys,Why is no one mentioning James Gandolfini in the comments?!
yNLaTtpovys,"Heyyy It&#39;s me, DANNY devito, baby!"
yNLaTtpovys,Hi WSB!!!!
yNLaTtpovys,Very underated
yNLaTtpovys,ha this is like silly Tarantino. they made the most random movies in the 90s
yNLaTtpovys,turns 25 today!<br>Barry Sonnenfeld actually loathed the movie when it was originally finished. But it caught on to industry professionals and made over $115 million.<br>Based on the book by Elmore Leonard which was pretty much his way of getting back at Hollywood but in a funny way. A black comedy but also a satire on the movie industry with commentary about power and creativity in Tinseltown. <br>There&#39;s a lot of talking but it&#39;s a very smart gangster movie.
yNLaTtpovys,A Great film 🙂
yNLaTtpovys,"Odd, I see most people commenting that they just found out Be Cool was a sequel. I just found out Be Cool was even a movie. Did not do Get Shorty justice."
yNLaTtpovys,"🔥🔥🔥🔥 <br> I feel reinvigorated <br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLaTtpovys&amp;t=0m34s"">0:34</a> 💗💕🎬 <br>  👇👇💖"
yNLaTtpovys,"🔥 <br> I absolutely love this movie. <br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLaTtpovys&amp;t=0m52s"">0:52</a> ❤💯 <br>  👇👇👇👇👇💕"
yNLaTtpovys,Aw darn I just watched be cool first!! I litterly just finished watching be cool! I mean I watched be cool before a long time ago but I never knew it was the sequel to this one! I would have watched this first! Oh well I guess I&#39;ll watch it now
yNLaTtpovys,More elmore Leonard movie please
yNLaTtpovys,"Better than I expected, I like the twist at the end."
yNLaTtpovys,Tony Soprano!
yNLaTtpovys,Alex Clark anyone?
yNLaTtpovys,The soundtrack to this movie inspired the theme song for the cooking show Good Eats.
yNLaTtpovys,Ya gotta love Elmore Leonard for his grasp and understanding of the seamy side of life and the people who <br>live it. Ya gotta love Barry Sonnenfeld for his appreciation for Elmore Leonard.  Ya Gotta love the cast for loving<br>Elmore Leonard and the script. And ya gotta love Get Shorty!!!!!
yNLaTtpovys,I can&#39;t wait to get into a cab and say &quot;The fuckin&#39; airport!&quot;
yNLaTtpovys,Quasimodo predicted James Gandolfini would be a big star a few years later.
yNLaTtpovys,"one year later, Danny De Vito makes Matilda... lol"
yNLaTtpovys,love travolta
yNLaTtpovys,LOLOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Poof-making! all over the place …)
yNLaTtpovys,&lt;3
yNLaTtpovys,Where could I look at it complete?
yNLaTtpovys,"Out of his 3 critically acclaimed films (The Addams Family, Get Shorty and Men in Black) he directed, this is Barry Sonnenfeld&#39;s best film he directed IMO."
yNLaTtpovys,I love get shorty and be cool I thought at first it sounded stupid but I love them
yNLaTtpovys,One of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life
yNLaTtpovys,I had no idea that &quot;Be Cool&quot; was a sequel.
yNLaTtpovys,ГОВНО А НЕ ФИЛЬМ! ПЫТАЛСЯ 2 РАЗА ПОСМОТРЕТЬ И ТАК И НЕ СМОГ УСНУЛ-НАХЕР!
yNLaTtpovys,"Holy shit, I didn´t know that Be Cool had a prequel!"
yNLaTtpovys,Excellent film. Love it!
yNLaTtpovys,i love harry Zimm..
yNLaTtpovys,Love this film!
yNLaTtpovys,Rough Business this Movie Business...!<br>Just the way we like it...!
yNLaTtpovys,10 years later i found out that Be Cool was the sequel. DAM SON
yNLaTtpovys,R.I.P ELMORE LEONARD
yNLaTtpovys,had no idea &quot;be cool&quot; was a sequel
yNLaTtpovys,Travolta is so badass in this movie.

lsmXhM4yfU0,I love how the trailer shows the murderer... smart.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"This is one of those movies that will remain with you it was done so well.
Unfortunately when it came out it was competing with some Box Office Sequels so it was overwhelmed and did well internationally and on rental at that time.

lsmXhM4yfU0,I loved it - especially the apartment! : )
lsmXhM4yfU0,"I agree with the killer from Se7en. All the preperation is scarier than anything. 

But Buffalo Bill from SotL is just as much of a copycat as &quot;Peter&quot;. since he copied Ed Gein. 
Or he&#39;s carracter is based on Gein anyway. 
Not just as disgusting tho. 

&quot;Peter&quot; at least chooses to copy the most infamous killers. ^_^"
lsmXhM4yfU0,"The concept is definitely one that seems to work and has been used in other movies as well.  This picture certainly wouldn&#39;t win any awards, but for some odd reason I enjoy watching it. Really enjoy this genre.  I can still see my mother so totally engrossed in it LOL.

Hmm...a remake might be a good idea.  I for one would love to see it."
lsmXhM4yfU0,TROLL MUCH.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"To each his own, I guess.

My mother was spellbound while watching this on TV.   I looked over and she was sitting on the edge of her seat during the entire second half.  Made me laugh because usually movies like this don&#39;t grab her in that way.  One of the reasons might have been that Weaver&#39;s character looked a lot like her when she was younger, so she associated with her.

Plus I&#39;m a fan of Holly Hunter.."

lsmXhM4yfU0,This is one terrific movie .. riveting from start to finish ... great acting .. and when Dermot&#39;s character is shot ... oh just so heartbreaking ... a classy piece of film
lsmXhM4yfU0,"And yes, I have seen Abduction with Sigourney. lease don;t mentiuon that. It&#39;s not even worth being called a movie."
lsmXhM4yfU0,Almost Anything Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver touch turn to gold.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"/watch?v=lu7s5XfXG0k

your the copycat"
lsmXhM4yfU0,@cotoxx22 The Police - Murder by numbers
lsmXhM4yfU0,Someone knows the name of the soundtrack? Is that The Police? Thanks
lsmXhM4yfU0,I luv dis movie. Dis will always in my opinion be one of da greatest movies of all times.
lsmXhM4yfU0,Aliens got Sigourney Weaver this role.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"Why did they set it up for a part 2 at the end, yet never followed through?"
lsmXhM4yfU0,"@Monii326 go to letmewatchtthis- im watching it right now, with one of the links lol... oh if ur a tv fan sidereel is good :)"
lsmXhM4yfU0,"this is one of the best psychological thriller i have ever watch~ way ahead its time, much more intelligent than most bullshit we have today. The camera work, the haunting score by christopher young and the screenplay is just terrific. But the sad thing is this movie did not the attention it deserves during its release in 1995."
lsmXhM4yfU0,LOVE THIS MOVIE my favorite part is when shes like &quot;Here kitty kitty kitty&quot;
lsmXhM4yfU0,Strange. The trailer for THIS movie uses music from The Pelican Brief and Interview with the Vampire...Totally not in the same genre. 
lsmXhM4yfU0,"@ReallyFunnyVidsNY Ok... I hope you are having a joke. If not, ana mareed!"
lsmXhM4yfU0,one of my favorite thriller movie..... oh Hands rocking the cradle is also good. Why cant we see those kind of thriller movies anymore!!!
lsmXhM4yfU0,@blisterpacman i love annoying u people[: lol anyway idk y i wrote that...
lsmXhM4yfU0,"I&#39;m looking for a movie I found in a video store once. I don&#39;t remember the title, but it seemed to be about a kind of eco-terrorist like the Unabomber and was apparently made in the 90s. Does anyone know what movie that could be?"
lsmXhM4yfU0,@mariopoolpoop1 and what&#39;s your point? seriously?
lsmXhM4yfU0,"The music of this movie is simply excellent, I hear it everyday from my playlist."
lsmXhM4yfU0,It may be scarier but the killer in this movie doesn&#39;t even compare to Se7en or Silence of the Lambs.
lsmXhM4yfU0,So under-rated!  Holly and Sigourney are on fire!
lsmXhM4yfU0,"the opening scene of this movie scared the shit out of me when i was little, i never saw the rest of it."
lsmXhM4yfU0,"Damn I remmber this vid..... :s
Scary shit."
lsmXhM4yfU0,Ms. Weaver is great in this movie. VERY thrilling. It got me into &#39;Murder By Numbers&#39; by The Police.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"The music used in this trailer is from &#39;The Pelican Brief&#39;, another excellent thriller."
lsmXhM4yfU0,Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) FTW!!!
lsmXhM4yfU0,"Add more tags! It&#39;s hard to find this trailer! By the way, very nice quality."
lsmXhM4yfU0,@mariopoolpoop1 lol&#39;d.
lsmXhM4yfU0,@WednezdayAddamz  what? no
lsmXhM4yfU0,i remember this - god it looks old.
lsmXhM4yfU0,"@mariopoolpoop1 hey, is this jessi slaughter"
lsmXhM4yfU0,THat redhaired girl on that hippie festival scared the fucking shit out of my ass
lsmXhM4yfU0,i love this movie and im 11
lsmXhM4yfU0,@evanscn07 seven....
lsmXhM4yfU0,AH HA !!!  I figured out what that music is from interview with the vampire the scene when louie and claudia are on the ship after they set lestat on fire !!
lsmXhM4yfU0,"scary as hell,these messages scared rhe crap out of me!"
lsmXhM4yfU0,love it....great movie
lsmXhM4yfU0,any more great thriller movie like this one?
lsmXhM4yfU0,This is kind of like silence of the lambs.  From watching the movie you would think that the guy in the trailer is the villian of the movie.  Same for Hannibal Lecter in silence of the lambs.
lsmXhM4yfU0,one of the best plots ever
lsmXhM4yfU0,I was joking. Relax. Take a deep breath. I&#39;ve seen the movie a thousand times. Saludos.
lsmXhM4yfU0,am telling the movie because i feel like it? do you have a problem with that? cause i hope you don´t. i don´t post comments in youtube to start a fight.
lsmXhM4yfU0,Harry Connick Jr is great as a serial killer.
lsmXhM4yfU0,Why are you telling the movie?
lsmXhM4yfU0,one of my all time favorite and a classic!!! love it!!
lsmXhM4yfU0,I watched this when I was about 10 years old and since then I&#39;ve felt uneasy whenever I went to one of those toilet booth-thingies that are open from the top.
OOTTvrb4JZI,"Had the privilege to watch this on cassette years ago, and what a legend of a film, that till this day I have not forgotten about. Such an amazing storyline, characters, and soundtrack too it, and it&#39;s extremely well done. As always Stallone movies are always legendary status, and Banderas is extremely underrated. A film with action, emotion, and much more. Honestly underrated, and a must-watch. I don&#39;t want to spoil much but its worth it. 12.25.19"
OOTTvrb4JZI,The Wachowski brothers wrote this script....then sold it.

OOTTvrb4JZI,como se llama la cancion del trailer ????????
OOTTvrb4JZI,"I think this film had the wrong cast, its ok but the actors just felt like they didn&#39;t suite the part, total miscast, like they tried to make julianne moore into a sharon stone type"
OOTTvrb4JZI,2020 of January
OOTTvrb4JZI,This is different version?

OOTTvrb4JZI,Just imagine a movie where Miguel Bain has the contract for Bruce Willis character in the Jackal
OOTTvrb4JZI,Awful movie.  Whatever the scriptwriter(s) was/were paid it was way too much.
OOTTvrb4JZI,&quot;A woman. It is not the same as killing a man. You have to pull the trigger a different way.&quot;<br><br>That has to be one of the funniest lines in Hollywood history! LOL!
OOTTvrb4JZI,Now on AXV
OOTTvrb4JZI,This movie should have had sequel one of Sylvester stallone best flim
OOTTvrb4JZI,"In Assassins, Antonio Banderas was a latin version of the Joker."
OOTTvrb4JZI,Great film
OOTTvrb4JZI,was he hold a floppy disk? gangsta lol
OOTTvrb4JZI,how to make cash the easy way /  bank / backfire / three generation strategy on making it around / adrenalina
OOTTvrb4JZI,Rocky Balboa/Rambo vs Armand
OOTTvrb4JZI,"I missed the the 90&#39;s movie, they had good actors smart plot no green screen and yet best movies ever."
OOTTvrb4JZI,one of best of Sylvester action flicks 100%
OOTTvrb4JZI,"Dhe amount of ritually-sickled hammers he had to polish in order to get where he is, dhough..."
OOTTvrb4JZI,"That scene where he says &quot;he&#39;s not dead yet&quot; isn&#39;t even in the picture, lol."
OOTTvrb4JZI,"I really loved this movie but I got really mad after I saw a scene where Dutch people were coming. I was waiting for them to speak DUTCH, and they were speaking GERMAN! There&#39;s a difference! Sometimes, those scripts are so dumb (and the writers)."
OOTTvrb4JZI,I hated Julianne Moore&#39;s character in this movie..otherwise decent flick!
OOTTvrb4JZI,Banderas&#39; accent reminds me of Montalban&#39;s Khan.
OOTTvrb4JZI,Antonio Banderas at the laptop gif ftw!
OOTTvrb4JZI,antonio banderas needs to get an oscar for his part in this movie
OOTTvrb4JZI,"thank you very much i was looking for it since long time, great quality"

gHl-UHu2-lM,is this a drama movie? looks intresing with all special effects tho im usually dont watch dramas!!
gHl-UHu2-lM,Lol I just sent this to my brother. The first time I watched this movie as a kid a lightning storm rolled through and struck a transformer right outside our window causing a huge explosion and loss of power. We had to watch it the next day when it was restored.  Was fitting with the theme though I&#39;d love to see this murdery version now.
gHl-UHu2-lM,the music at end of trailer i feel is wrong as it makes Powder/Jeremy out to be a demon something relay bad and scary when he wasent okay some of the stuff was scary but he was a really sweet guy
gHl-UHu2-lM,lol bravo you done the impossible...your re-cut trailer with its creepy music made it sound like powder is a psycho serial killer lmao
gHl-UHu2-lM,.ℒℴѵe..ℒℴѵe..ℒℴѵe.
gHl-UHu2-lM,i have this movie on DVD  somewhere also found the full movie on Putlocker one of my fav movie sites
gHl-UHu2-lM,Hey
gHl-UHu2-lM,awesome beautiful movie loved it and i just loved Jeremy yet he could be scary at times with some of the stuff he did 
gHl-UHu2-lM,super emotionaler und mitfühlender film ! 
gHl-UHu2-lM,I&#39;m not a fan of this re-cut trailer simply because the cut and music has made this film seem like it&#39;s a horror movie. It is deeper than this trailer is portraying it and is giving the wrong impression of its subject.
gHl-UHu2-lM,would like to see a cameo by the superhero freakozoid
gHl-UHu2-lM,work.work.
gHl-UHu2-lM,i totally misssed this gem.... thanks guys.... i left a love note... ksiksi

gHl-UHu2-lM,It not Rated R p13
gHl-UHu2-lM,i commune with powder on a regular basis. he is real. he is alive.
gHl-UHu2-lM,My mom likes this movie. I like it!
gHl-UHu2-lM,This is me when I don&#39;t tan
gHl-UHu2-lM,"yes another music would have be great
"
gHl-UHu2-lM,Great job!
gHl-UHu2-lM,Waaaay ahead of its time
gHl-UHu2-lM,It IS his best piece of work:D
gHl-UHu2-lM,i didn&#39;t know.. he looked younger. wow this is one of his best work
gHl-UHu2-lM,He&#39;s so brilliant in this film. Did you also know that he was about 30 years old in this?
gHl-UHu2-lM,This is very well done. 
gHl-UHu2-lM,8^O  omg!! i had no idea that was sean p. flanery!!.. that is amazing

UMlYWZgCIgo,"Masterpiece, 26y ago....."
UMlYWZgCIgo,"I saw this movie, why leave las vegas, this movie should be called staying las vegas"
UMlYWZgCIgo,This is a great trailer
UMlYWZgCIgo,Cages best film!
UMlYWZgCIgo,Do jaJa
UMlYWZgCIgo,Never knew Nic Cage won an Oscar<br>thanks brooklyn 99<br>now i might watch this..
UMlYWZgCIgo,what movie...five stars
UMlYWZgCIgo,Leaving Las Vegas movie stripper shorthair blonde name???
UMlYWZgCIgo,Leaving Las Vegas crushes my heart every time I see it. An awful and beautiful story about how two desperate people fall into a codependent relationship. There are few movies that are as good as this one.
UMlYWZgCIgo,This film is poetry. Elisabeth Shue is breathtaking.
UMlYWZgCIgo,This movie actually did really good at the box office and it&#39;s kinda funny to think that this trailer might&#39;ve been a reason why so many people were attracted to see it.
UMlYWZgCIgo,"Everytime I hear someone  talk about leaving las vegas, it always reminds of family guy where that liquor store guy and chris talk about movies."
UMlYWZgCIgo,Oh shit!! My future!!
UMlYWZgCIgo,I love this movie one of the greatest movie of all times....<br>Nicolas and Elizabeth have done a Great job
UMlYWZgCIgo,Terrible trailer; great film.
UMlYWZgCIgo,but does he really deserve an Oscar because of this movie !!!
UMlYWZgCIgo,best movie EVER !
UMlYWZgCIgo,I plan on becoming an alchoholic and killing everyone
UMlYWZgCIgo,Recently saw this movie and it was one of the best ive seen in a long time. Very well put together and touching storyline. One of Cages best works. Great Movie.
UMlYWZgCIgo,That was funny :)
UMlYWZgCIgo,Watching movies just because Nicolas Cage is in it.
UMlYWZgCIgo,"Sad beginning, sad characters, sad ending..just a sad movie..: ("
UMlYWZgCIgo,"One of my all-time-favourites.<br>I had a severe drinking problem myself, had to detox twice.<br>So i know what i&#39;m talking about when i say that this flick is realistic. &lt;3<br>Thanks for posting."
UMlYWZgCIgo,I think this movie is the best movie about both alcoholism and Las Vegas.
UMlYWZgCIgo,Your welcome!!!! :P
UMlYWZgCIgo,thx for the spoiler...
UMlYWZgCIgo,"I know it seems strange to respond to my own comment but no one else did, so I had to eventually help myself.....
I really didn&#39;t know who those two people were until I was relatively sober, then I had the common sense to look them up under the heading &quot;Leaving Las Vegas full cast&quot;
The bartender is actor Graham Beckel.
The &quot;pretty lady&quot; is actress Mariska Hargitay.
Thank you both for your parts in this great movie."
UMlYWZgCIgo,"i came here to drink myself to death,"
UMlYWZgCIgo,cry more.
UMlYWZgCIgo,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!
UMlYWZgCIgo,this movie sucked...
UMlYWZgCIgo,"Precious scene at 0:13. &quot;I really wish you would come home with me, you&#39;re so cute and I&#39;m really good in bed too believe me...... no ?  O.K.&quot;
I will be very impressed if you can tell me the actress that Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is talking to, it&#39;s that pretty lady who licks her lips before her other facial expression rejects him.
The bartender, what&#39;s that actor&#39;s name ?
You need to appreciate those people, you take them for granted, you probably take way too many people for granted. "
UMlYWZgCIgo,Dude!!! I&#39;m a male and my comment has nothing to do with feminism. It&#39;s about how rapists piss me off.
UMlYWZgCIgo,It&#39;s because of how realistic that scene was. Didn&#39;t you get mad when you watched that scene?
UMlYWZgCIgo,"Loved the film so much I felt the same way. power of cinema.
"
UMlYWZgCIgo,why would anything like the lack of a moral ever persuade you that something was worth hating? 
UMlYWZgCIgo,"easy ,man :) It&#39;s just a film."
UMlYWZgCIgo,I love this movie. I can relate so well to cage in this.
UMlYWZgCIgo,"I love this movie, but the reason I watch it over and over is because Elizabeth Shue is so hot. It is almost distracting. "
UMlYWZgCIgo,como nicolas cage de living las vegas 
UMlYWZgCIgo,rubius!!!!!!!
UMlYWZgCIgo,NICHOLAS CAGE TE ESTA OBSERVANDO O_O
UMlYWZgCIgo,nicolas nunca muda mesmo kkk
UMlYWZgCIgo,"If this is good, what is awesome?"
UMlYWZgCIgo,This trailer prepares you for absolutely 0% of what you watch... 
UMlYWZgCIgo,"You should watch Requiem for a dream. If you can make it through the whole film without feeling sick, then you&#39;re seriously disturbed."
UMlYWZgCIgo,You obviously didnt get the point then lol
UMlYWZgCIgo,Makes it look like a film about 2 people who turn their lives around when its anything but that. Also makes it seem alot more lighthearted than it actually is.
UMlYWZgCIgo,"Lol, Nic Cage worste actor."
UMlYWZgCIgo,"This film is the truth and notting but the truth.
"
UMlYWZgCIgo,i miss voice overs in movie trailers
UMlYWZgCIgo,Couldn&#39;t agree anymore!!
UMlYWZgCIgo,he look like hunter s.thompson
UMlYWZgCIgo,A masterpiece. I needed a big shot of whiskey myself after watching this film. 
UMlYWZgCIgo,Your comment made me weep. This movie is earth shattering for people that battle drinking and REALIZE IT. Thank you for saying it....... really hit home.
UMlYWZgCIgo,You get a LOL for that comment from me!! Good on ya!!!!!
UMlYWZgCIgo,What do you mean?
UMlYWZgCIgo,"the only thing i hate about this movie is the frat boys that raped sera get away with it. i wanted to see them get beat up, jailed, castrated, or even killed. i just wanted to reach through the screen and fuck those guys up. what a bunch of creeps, she didn&#39;t want to have anal with them. so, they just go and beat the shit out of her, and fuck her up real bad. i wish all rapist would have their balls cut off."
UMlYWZgCIgo,All these &#39;90s trailers were always so upbeat for such depressing films!!!!
UMlYWZgCIgo,Thank you
UMlYWZgCIgo,its lonely teardrops by michael mcdonald
UMlYWZgCIgo,did you find it?
UMlYWZgCIgo,"very good movie
"
UMlYWZgCIgo,"what&#39;s the soundtrack called by the way ??? 
"
UMlYWZgCIgo,What type of movie is it?
UMlYWZgCIgo,"Anyone who has ever been to the point of their lives where they believe that they will eventually die living that VERY point that brought them there should watch this movie, you are not alone."
UMlYWZgCIgo,and where the trailers spoil the whole movie
UMlYWZgCIgo,Are you sure that is the same movie?
UMlYWZgCIgo,Not a good trailer for this movie.
UMlYWZgCIgo,what a shitty commercial. 
UMlYWZgCIgo,I&#39;ve seen better. The movie was kinda boring honestly
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@WorleyClarence no, u did it cuz ur a dumb fuck."
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@TheEirinaki95 Come Rain, or Come Shine."
UMlYWZgCIgo,"oh hollywood, did you try to make a movie about turning a hoe into a housewife, even worse you used crazy nicolas to be the leading man. I can understand richard geare but nicolas cage? Well then thats called crack head falls in love with street hooker"
UMlYWZgCIgo,"In the end credits: The events, characters, and firms depicted in this photoplay are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual firms is purely concidental."
UMlYWZgCIgo,"The worst part about this trailer, is the narrator. "
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@roscoegino Haha good point :&#39;) it&#39;s a terrible loss for the acting industry, what he really needs is a film like Kick Ass again: a blockbuster that actually shows his considerable talents :)"
UMlYWZgCIgo,@Jeffo193 They don&#39;t pay for mansions he can&#39;t afford.
UMlYWZgCIgo,Why is his major addiction to alcohol so subtle and hidden in this trailer? It plays a massive part in the film...
UMlYWZgCIgo,"I love how the trailers change through time. If this was a trailer now, it would be considered appalling. "
UMlYWZgCIgo,This movie showed Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue at their very best. It&#39;s about a codependent relationship between an alcoholic (Cage) hell bent on drinking himself to death and a prostitute (Shue) that attempts to give him unconditional love. This movie will break your heart and show you want really good acting is all about.
UMlYWZgCIgo,Worst trailer for a really great movie
UMlYWZgCIgo,Shue hasn&#39;t aged well.....she used to be top class.
UMlYWZgCIgo,nick cage won the oscar for this role!
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@Fanofcartoons1994 

Agreed. This movie was very serious and sad."
UMlYWZgCIgo,Most people who live in this city has a love/hate relationship with her. 
UMlYWZgCIgo,@ingasa13 coz it wont come in 3D and theres no happy meal toys that&#39;ll come with it.
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@naklip It&#39;s &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot; the famous version was by Jackie Wilson, but this one is sung by Michael McDonald (that used to be a Doobie Bro. and sometimes sang for Steely Dan)"
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@PetroniusSatyricon69 Ha, I know! I loved this movie and knew then that I never wanted to see it again. Damn good actor. "
UMlYWZgCIgo,Top Movie
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@tareyagreen Haha, I know right? This trailer makes the movie seem like it has some lovey-dovey happy ending "
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@naklip lol
"
UMlYWZgCIgo,"yeah this story is horrible, desperate and sad, totally inappropriate music and narrator!"
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@Jeffo193  Totally agree. This movie shows the great potential of what Cage can do with good material, or wise versa.  Sad to see such a great actor waste his talent on movies like Drive Angry or The sorc Apprentice.
But i guess that&#39;s what happens when you bankrupt yourself, you&#39;re forced to take whatever gets tossed in your way..  Beggars can&#39;t be choosers.

A real loss for the acting industry. 
"
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@EGarrett01 And also, because some of the trailers i posted had more quality that the ones who were already on youtube."
UMlYWZgCIgo,"@EGarrett01 I put &quot;hq&quot; to get more views, kind of stupid when i think about it now. I have to remove it in all the trailers."
UMlYWZgCIgo,@EGarrett01 LoLOlOLoLol
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Can you tell me how can I download this movie.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I grew up in the 60s and 70s and this depicts those times and memories perfectly. No Internet or cell phones  ... just you and your friends making up your own fun as the summer rolled along. I wish I had a time machine because I wouldn&#39;t give 2023 a second glance. ✌❤➡

RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Millennials, we had it good."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Why did they pick Rosie O’Donnell for Christina Ricci 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I love this movie with Devon Sawa of course❤❤❤😂
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"even though I was born in 2007, growing up this was my all time favorite movie and still very much is. I first watched this around the age of 5/6 (It was introduced to me by my mom who was born in 1986) and I just repetitively kept doing so lol. I also just loved the &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; by The Archies, because my nickname was Suga, so I always thought the guy in the song was singing it to me when I was like 5 😂.. I just remember around the age of 6/7 riding my bike down my neighborhood blocks singing that one song from the bike scene over and over everyday that I almost convinced myself I was living in the 70s-90s. <br>I&#39;ve for some reason always been attracted to movies from the 80s and 90s growing up that I sometimes believe that I was alive back then and reincarnated into who I am now lol."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Feel-good-movie... So love it. Watched a long time ago, still love it, 65yearsold now... Nice soundtrack... Sugar sugar and knock three times. Watch it, it&#39;s on u tube, starring demi Moore and melanie griffith."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"This was My Daughter&#39;s Favorite Movie, because Her Mom died in a car crash 1yr before the Movie. Broke My Heart."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,beautiful movie. ❤
RQLVzTtt2Ws,My childhood.  Met my best friend in 1969 and we are still best friends.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Looking back as an adult. Rosie &#39;o Donald as cristina ricci was an interesting pic, imo."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Just watched this for the first time last night. Such a great movie. ❤
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Spectacular! Love this movie with 	<br>Christina Ricci<br>Thora Birch<br>Gaby Hoffmann<br>Ashleigh Aston Moore<br>Melanie Griffith<br>Demi Moore<br>Rosie O&#39;Donnell<br>Rita Wilson
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I discovered this movie in 2014 when I wqas 15 years old. I still like this movie a lot.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I wish I had a summer like them.<br>I watched it over the weekend and always wished that it had a summer agenda like theirs.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,My mom grew up in the 70s so she can definitely relate
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I love love that movie 😍
RQLVzTtt2Ws,no wtf bc why did my memories lied to me thinkimg that roberta kissed a girl now im left disappointed &gt;:(
RQLVzTtt2Ws,What a film
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Hey where can I watch it?
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Where can I watch this
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"One of my lifetime favorite movies, so many memories.. I love the most Roberta character as a teen, but now I realize I relate the most as Samantha character by the resemblances of our char"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Definitely a film for soppy girly creatures!
RQLVzTtt2Ws,This was my childhood and I miss it
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Did anyone notice that Chrissy married to the boy she said to get lost when she was 12 years old
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Perhaps the perfect double feature with young girls in those oldies era from New Line with HAIRSPRAY, which took place even earlier"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Is beautiful
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Rosie sucked in this may be the rest of them was pretty good
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Demi Moore looks like a real life version of Esmeralda in the thumbnail, this was before the The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) I can hear Esmeralda speaking"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I love this movie. I wish I had a friendship group growing up that mimic this.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"I looked up the &quot;No and then&quot; scene from Dude, wheres my car and this movie trailer was one of the recommended videos haha."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Buena película
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Casting for this movie was great
RQLVzTtt2Ws,What is the song?
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"I miss my childhood! No technology, social media, and popular tutorials. So much fun"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,One of my favorite movies.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I saw this film because of Christina Ricci. Love this girl always.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Love this movie!!
RQLVzTtt2Ws,This is my favourite movie of all time
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Never seen it but I want to, now and then truly does look like a very interesting movie and it looks like a good one too."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Is the music that starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQLVzTtt2Ws&amp;t=0m54s"">0:54</a> from The War (1994) composed by Thomas Newman? I recognized it right away."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I’ve been looking for 7 months just to figure out what this movie is called
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I’m the youngest out of 3. The only male. My 2 older sisters introduced me to this movie and I grew to love it. Now that I have 2 daughters I finally have 2 legitimate excuses on why to buy this movie and show it to my Wife lol Yay.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"To everyone that says &quot;I wish my childhood is more like this&quot;, MAKE your childhood like this...are kids these days a this stupid? It&#39;s not hard. Just DO things rather than stare at YouTube. No offense but DUUUH!"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"dude, this is cool"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Went to the cinema with my friends to see this when we were 14 when it came out. Loved it then and love it now.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Chrissy has got to be my favorite character.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Lame movie. Pushed to hard to be like a stand by me movie. Plus it has Melanie and demi in it barf
RQLVzTtt2Ws,💕
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Missing my childhood
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"RIP, Ashleigh Aston Moore 🕊"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,The way Christina Ricci owned the 90s 🖤
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Ten Bucks
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Rosie O&#39;Donnell I Don&#39;t Wanna Be Told To Grow Up Simple Plan
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"This movie is when I really started liking Christina, but 2 things bug me still...<br><br>1. they spend so much time making the point of friends helping each other through tough times and then end the &quot;Then&quot; part by saying oops the treehouse brought them &quot;independence from each other&quot; and the &quot;Now&quot; versions of them don&#39;t even care about meeting up hardly ever.<br><br>2. In all these years STILL they haven&#39;t done a release with the carnival scenes and any other deleted scenes. And not even a blu ray release either. I&#39;d like to have a release with tons of new scenes because I like the whole setting of the movie and it&#39;s pretty short and no sequel, so such a small amount of time to see them in that setting. Also, personally, I&#39;d hope for them put all back into it as a director&#39;s cut where the movie is longer."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"I totally forgot that this was called The Gaslight Addition in the beginning, even while Christina was talking about it.<br><br>Also, funny they dubbed in a different word in the trailer for when Roberta says what she will do if Devon&#39;s character tells his friends that they kissed."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I had a childhood like this. I feel like as a  millennial we grew up with technology and the outside. I was born in the end of the 80s and so  I remember being thrown outside and fighting my cousin and friends. Riding my bike and skateboard and running amok about my backyard. Than finished the day off with some video games on Sega.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,It’s sad because teeny saves Sam
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I loved this movie 🎥 as a child and even now and I’m a millennial !!! I really enjoyed it !
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I feel like us 90s kids were the last generation to grow up outside lol our parents used to lock us out of house during the summers hahahaha!
RQLVzTtt2Ws,So Roberta and Scott already shared a kiss in Casper ❤️
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Llevo tiempo buscandola . Donde la puedo ver por favor ?
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Any fellow ‘95 babies here?
RQLVzTtt2Ws,love how this movie and Casper both came out the year I was born - 1995
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Christina Ricci  grows up to be Rosie O&#39;Donnell, boy did they get that wrong"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,A few scenes were changed afterward! Love this movie!
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Didn&#39;t care for the casting of adult version of the characters. Except for Demi Moore
RQLVzTtt2Ws,DEMI MOORE YOU&#39;RE BEAUTIFUL
RQLVzTtt2Ws,This movie is iconic with a killer soundtrack. I remember a friend showing me this when I was a kid back in 1999 and it stuck with me for over a decade until I found it again after many attempts of searching for it because I didn’t know the name of it lol
RQLVzTtt2Ws,so jealous my childhood wasn’t like this
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Born in 1989, watched this movie with my twin sister in my early childhood.... and remembered it today... overflown by memories 🥺❤"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I feel that way too IF My Parents were like that living in a Different state living in a place like that
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Put it on Netflix and Starz on demand
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"That song at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQLVzTtt2Ws&amp;t=1m29s"">1:29</a>- The nostalgia!!!"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Lol

RQLVzTtt2Ws,Rip Ashley Moore
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Best movie!
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s this movie was basically what my childhood was like. I feel sorry for kids nowadays.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I  used to watch this with my grandma and my fav was chrissy
RQLVzTtt2Ws,“Now and then” is my all time movie
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"Awesome &quot;coming-of-age&quot; movie, like &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, except with girls."
RQLVzTtt2Ws,pls tell me where can i watch this. I really need to watch this. Just gimme the link or whateva. It’s not available on netflix anyway.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Rest In Peace Ashleigh Aston Moore AKA Chrisy
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Ricci!!!!! ❤️
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I feel like Bonnie Hunt ad-libbed that &quot;boo ha&quot; line.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,My childhood
RQLVzTtt2Ws,👍👍👍👍 small boy and girl small beautiful excellent movie
RQLVzTtt2Ws,MY CHILDHOOD IS RUINED IF I DIDNT WATCHED THIS MOVIE
RQLVzTtt2Ws,"A warmth around my heart this movie brings... So many childhood memories.. Me and my friends used to have a childhood like this , without technology and just playing on the street all day long on summer.. Riding our bikes, singing, making “movies” and “concerts” and who knows what else.. We were so blessed and happy to be growing up in 90s. I believe it was the last decade we could have been old school children. There was no wifi, smartphones, selfies,fake lives made on fb and instagram, we were just out there playing and dreaming... We were out there being KIDS! Oh how I wish those times could come back. I still dream of going to video store to borrow a movie and just living that simplicity we once had.. Silly I know..Who knows, maybe we wake up one day from a matrix and start living true lives once again. Ahh, we grew up so fast didn’t we..?!? ☺️ Anyway.. God bless you all.. And kids, if you’re reading this: GO OUT AND PLAY!! Life is fantastic! ❤️"
RQLVzTtt2Ws,N gf 95 😀dkaa dkasad  d dkc r dkc
RQLVzTtt2Ws,One of my favorite movies
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Dakota Johnson looks so much like her mom here.
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Love this movie. Brings back great memories of childhood
RQLVzTtt2Ws,TEENY AND ROBERTA ARE MY FAVORITES BECAUSE THEY REPRECENT MY 2 PASSIONS MOVIES AND SPORTS
RQLVzTtt2Ws,Guys where is scott in the ending?
RQLVzTtt2Ws,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!
RQLVzTtt2Ws,One of my all time favorite movies!
lYSHAyODiGs,Favorite Austen novel and favorite adaptation. TERRIBLE trailer!
lYSHAyODiGs,💗🌹
lYSHAyODiGs,My favourite version of Persuasion!
lYSHAyODiGs,"Well, this looks MUCH more intriguing and angsty than that new boring Persuassion."
lYSHAyODiGs,Best version!
lYSHAyODiGs,omg what is a desire?   lol we’re they trying to ruin this great movie with this horrid trailer?
lYSHAyODiGs,"After Netflix ruining the soul of the &quot;persuasion&quot;, I came here for finding something just like the novel..."
lYSHAyODiGs,"I came here after Netflix&#39; Persuasion with Dakota Johnson. Undeniably, this is still the best version of the novel... Netflix 2022 version is a second-rate, trying hard copy cat."
lYSHAyODiGs,The casting is pretty on point ngl
lYSHAyODiGs,Forget the clownish trailer. The only clownish thing about the film that keeps it from being a complete masterpiece is the weird circus parade right near the end.
lYSHAyODiGs,"I very much enjoyed this movie, but I also like the earlier movie as well. I think the depth of feeling shows better in the earlier version than this one. I do not think the trailer quite describes the movie as it was.  There are feelings hard to put in a movie. Anyway, I did love this movie and  also the other version, which I think is from 1971."
lYSHAyODiGs,Haha! If I hadn’t seen  this movie before I would totally be fooled by the trailer it makes it sound like an exciting passionate love fest🤔 In reality it is a beautifully acted and perfectly made adaptation of my favourite book. Remember seeing it on BBC 2 when first released and even went to see it when it was released in the cinema.  Now treasure it on DVD. Ciaran Hinds was so handsome as Wentworth and Amanda Root was brilliant as Anne.😉
lYSHAyODiGs,one film that actually needs a reboot..
lYSHAyODiGs,My most favorite movie!
lYSHAyODiGs,"I like this story so much and I hadn&#39;t had the courage to watch this version of 1995 for a long time, because Anne seemed to me ugly. But now I have finally watched this movie and I didn&#39;t see anything ugly - quite normal Anne)) The actress presented quite a convincing Anne. Liked this version. Especially the scenes where Anne had to listen to the Musgroves who were complaining her about one another in turn)"
lYSHAyODiGs,what&#39;s with the &quot;honest movie trailer&#39;s&quot; voiceover?
lYSHAyODiGs,These american voice overs :D
lYSHAyODiGs,"God, what an awful trailer! Nothing at all to do with the film, which is lovely and not about a passion that could destroy them both. This is Jane Austen, not a bodice ripper ffs."
lYSHAyODiGs,This trailer just makes me laugh. The only true thing is that the main character indeed looks scared for half of the film: from mildly corncerned to a &quot;deer in headlights&quot;.
lYSHAyODiGs,"Superb film, but a travesty of a trailer which gives a completely distorted impression of the film."
lYSHAyODiGs,"What classical piece begins to play at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYSHAyODiGs&amp;t=0m07s"">0:07</a>? It is driving me crazy that I can&#39;t find it anywhere!"
lYSHAyODiGs,"This trailer is ridiculous ...<br>Never mind, the film is fabulous and very true to the book.<br>Some posters wrote that the main female character is &quot;ugly&quot;. I don&#39;t see it. <br>Amanda Root is not the conventional pretty heroine, she is rather plain in the beginning (but never ugly!), but the longer she&#39;s near Captain Wentworth, the prettier she gets. She really blossoms like a flower when he speaks to her and you see that he notices. <br>In my opinion Amanda Root is perfect in this role and Ciarán Hinds - swoon ...<br>The whole cast is very well chosen and looks so authentic."
lYSHAyODiGs,This trailer doesn&#39;t do the film justice. I hate the man&#39;s voice over! The 1995 version is the best of any adaptation on film. It is perfection.
lYSHAyODiGs,That man is the hottest 😍😍😍 ( I&#39;m young but I adore him)
lYSHAyODiGs,"It&#39;s hard to believe this was originally made for television, then released in movie theaters.  This movie is a MASTERPIECE.  It&#39;s artful, brilliantly acted, and has an organic beauty about it that you won&#39;t see anywhere else."
lYSHAyODiGs,Amanda Root just is Anne Elliot!
lYSHAyODiGs,ESTA  ESTA  EN  ESPAÑOL  POR FAVOR
lYSHAyODiGs,This is truly one of the worst trailers I&#39;ve ever seen.
lYSHAyODiGs,"Every single person I have ever dated have no wealth, no titles and no connections.  Lady Russell would never approve."
lYSHAyODiGs,I wish they would re-make this movie
lYSHAyODiGs,"This trailer is a masterclass in video editing. I think there isn&#39;t a single sentence in this that isn&#39;t completely ripped out of context and misleading. It&#39;s an entirely different film in fact than the one I love. Which is strongly acted, sedately paced and very close to the book in many respects."
lYSHAyODiGs,"Don&#39;t be put off by this trailer. The film is NOT about a passion that could destroy them both (what?) If you love the book, you will love this version."
lYSHAyODiGs,It&#39;s one of my favorites...
lYSHAyODiGs,"I&#39;ve never seen this and I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s good, but it sure doesn&#39;t look much like Jane Austen&#39;s book."
toH1vzAmDBI,This is a perfect representation of what movie trailer should be like. Amazing visuals.
toH1vzAmDBI,"I know your comment&#39;s 2 years old, but if you&#39;re still wondering, the song is &quot;L&#39;Anniversaire d&#39;Irvin&quot; from this movie&#39;s soundtrack."
toH1vzAmDBI,"I&#39;m pretty sure the clip of the clone putting the lid over the camera is an alternate take from the scene in the actual film, which is kind of neat.
Come to think of it, I don&#39;t remember that scene of the scientist seeing the kids through the periscope. I gotta wonder how much was cut from the final version."
toH1vzAmDBI,Bioshock
toH1vzAmDBI," This movie is so old it should be public domain by now.  I owned this on magnetic tape, for heaven&#39;s sake.  Sony Pcitures are a bunch of cheapos for not letting you view it in full. Who would buy something so old that you can rent for next to nothing?"
toH1vzAmDBI,/watch?v=KRF78AGvIoQ
toH1vzAmDBI,"this is my favourite movie.
full soundtrack uploaded on my channel btw;)"
toH1vzAmDBI,What is the name of the song that plays in the trailer?
toH1vzAmDBI,win
toH1vzAmDBI,"Creepy movie... Love it
"
toH1vzAmDBI,One of my all-time favourite movies
toH1vzAmDBI,eerie
toH1vzAmDBI,can you upload the whole movie?
toH1vzAmDBI,cool.
mQf3Ngg2cks,Very good movie!
mQf3Ngg2cks,Gong Li has been one of my fave actresses. She&#39;s always on point
mQf3Ngg2cks,I&#39;m just starving for a box set of Zhang Yimou&#39;s earlier films.. where are they????
mQf3Ngg2cks,"I had already thought Gong Li was among the very best actors on the world, and so beautiful. Her beauty in this film took my breath away. If there was a more beautiful woman in the world back then..........well, there just wasn&#39;t."
mQf3Ngg2cks,Gong Li looks like an Asian Madonna here.
mQf3Ngg2cks,"It’s on Amazon Prime in the U.K. at the moment for free.  Barry Norman put it on his Top 10 Best List of 1995, so that’s what got me on to this film."
mQf3Ngg2cks,Just saw it. Liked. Gong Li is an awesome actress
mQf3Ngg2cks,Where is wang ya nan

gA-5nLQCmW8,RIP COOLIO
gA-5nLQCmW8,"Great movie. Another one in this same realm is &quot;Freedom Writers&quot;, very good."
gA-5nLQCmW8,"True G, R.I.P Coolio"
gA-5nLQCmW8,U REST COOLIO🙌🏻
gA-5nLQCmW8,R.I.P. Coolio and Wade Dominguez.

gA-5nLQCmW8,Hit like if coolios death brought you here
gA-5nLQCmW8,This movie came out when I was in eighth grade. One year before starting hs. My hs wasn’t this bad but it still kinda helped me prepare for the worst mentally. I loved this movie so much. It’s still one of my favourites.
gA-5nLQCmW8,"Great movie! It&#39;s like To Sir With Love (1967), but the American version."
gA-5nLQCmW8,2022 dif one of my top list for ever !
gA-5nLQCmW8,oi tribo
gA-5nLQCmW8,"This movie would just be dismissed as racist if it were released today. It’s unimaginable for anyone, let alone a white woman, to suggest that an African American might bare responsibility for the choices that they make. It’s hard to believe that there was a time period where such critiques were even possible to say out loud. <br><br>My how far we’ve fallen"
gA-5nLQCmW8,This movie seems cringy as hell now that I&#39;m an adult.
gA-5nLQCmW8,"I work with kid&#39;s like these, done this for like 25 years now, for free. Just because I love them. And of course, this is my favorite film ever 🥰💕"
gA-5nLQCmW8,The book Quiet by Susan Cain brought me here :)...
gA-5nLQCmW8,If only they played Dungeons and Dragons and read lord of the rings instead. 👍
gA-5nLQCmW8,This movie does have bones &quot; You and Me!&quot;....
gA-5nLQCmW8,None of the actors/actresses who played the students. I didn’t really see any of them I’m anything else
gA-5nLQCmW8,"Kazzy, fifa?"
gA-5nLQCmW8,this is like the birth of Jesus.
gA-5nLQCmW8,This is by far one of the best movies you can ever watch.
gA-5nLQCmW8,"Once a Marine, always a Marine!"
gA-5nLQCmW8,me and kazz!
gA-5nLQCmW8,I get goosebumps every time I watch this. I have lived on and off the streets since I was 14. I went to a special ed school called Norwood morialta cause it was the only school that would take me. It doesn&#39;t matter what color skin you got cause I know I&#39;m a white gangsta. And I am proud of being a gangsta
gA-5nLQCmW8,187 (1997) was better than this trite movie
gA-5nLQCmW8,Meme song go funny haha
gA-5nLQCmW8,"&#39;Yea though I walk through this valley of the shadows of death; I WILL fear NO evil!&#39; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irf5wpuyabE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irf5wpuyabE</a>"

gA-5nLQCmW8,1994: There are no victims in this classroom<br>2020: ______________________________________(Fill in the gap)
gA-5nLQCmW8,"I went to this school. In the movie, it&#39;s called Parkmont, but the school is really called Carlmont High School, in Belmont California. The movie is based of a book called &quot;My Posse don&#39;t do Homework&quot; and was written in 1992, so obviously I wasn&#39;t alive back then, but I remember by AP US history teacher telling us about the woman who wrote this book and her story. It seems so surreal to me, even now, that I went to the school where this story took place."
gA-5nLQCmW8,They should remake this movie
gA-5nLQCmW8,"Think she genuinely wanted to help them,  but like she said you all gotta choose, think she worded it wrong at times although she never meant to make them feel inadequate (she wondered how she could teach them what a verb was, not because they lacked intelligence quite the opposite I think)..know your kids, know how they work, know how they learn, know how they feel and master it to gain respect and make there learning fun, then they will listen if you save one at least you did something and that is an achievement in itself, so never give up teaching, if you don&#39;t like what you teach how can you expect your kids too? All teachers have a tough rap but never give up your learning them more than you think"
gA-5nLQCmW8,2020??
gA-5nLQCmW8,"&quot;There are no victims in this classroom&quot; yet, the same bunch keep trying to convince people they are victims of the system and thus taking away their willpower to achieve success."
gA-5nLQCmW8,C00chieman
gA-5nLQCmW8,I love this movie. Wish there was more teachers like her now days. There hard to find now.
gA-5nLQCmW8,"What are the scenes of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA-5nLQCmW8&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA-5nLQCmW8&amp;t=1m18s"">1:18</a>?🥺🥺"
gA-5nLQCmW8,I remember going to theater to see this.
gA-5nLQCmW8,This movie is a classic. but please stop making this type of movie today. Let this one be the one
gA-5nLQCmW8,Why my mom its telling me thats one of the best movies<br><br><br>I dont like it 🙄🤔
gA-5nLQCmW8,&quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; what a movie! Another movie added to my favourite list.  I literally cried in the end of the movie. Michelle Pfeiffer&#39;s performance is so great. Also each &amp; every characters were so touchy.. 😍😍
gA-5nLQCmW8,"This was the first movie I ever saw in a theater, I was 2"
gA-5nLQCmW8,Is this freedom writers before freedom writers
gA-5nLQCmW8,&quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; and &quot;The Principal&quot; are somewhat similar plot-wise.

gA-5nLQCmW8,Action
gA-5nLQCmW8,"To think this movie was based on the high school my sisters went to. I can promise it wasn’t this bad, they obviously had to make it look worst than it was. Things have obviously gotten much better though."
gA-5nLQCmW8,&quot;most of my students don&#39;t even know what a verb is&quot; That&#39;s cause understanding what a verb is is not actually innate to human survival.
gA-5nLQCmW8,Beautiful movie highly recommend 9/10
gA-5nLQCmW8,Love old movies. They had heart. ❤️
gA-5nLQCmW8,"it is a choice whether to fight against the institution while trying your best, fight against the institution and blame all your mistakes on it, or not fight against the institution at all."
gA-5nLQCmW8,I feel like this is the original freedom writers
gA-5nLQCmW8,"Never saw the movie, would always see the trailer on tv. She did the king Fu block and the marine speech just like I remembered"
gA-5nLQCmW8,I was 2 years old or 3 years old when I watched this movie.
gA-5nLQCmW8,"So, like Gokusen?😂"
gA-5nLQCmW8,X helped so a cop could
gA-5nLQCmW8,I remembered how many scenes in this trailer didn&#39;t make it in the movie. They cut out a lot once it appeared in theaters.
gA-5nLQCmW8,Micheal Tandino &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;<br>disturbata di Croma <br>è il Bronx non è Harlem<br>oramai sempre in prima io sono Tenente Stelle Argento
gA-5nLQCmW8,What a brilliant film
gA-5nLQCmW8,I don&#39;t know why critics seem to hate this film so much. The premise is cheesy but it&#39;s so true. There are schools like this even today. I thought the way the students acted was really true to life. I remember being in school and I remember kids like this and how they would engage with an inspiring teacher like Michele Pfeiffers character. It was an important time in culture and I think Dangerous Minds is a great little artefact.
gA-5nLQCmW8,This movie was a great one... showing the sad reality in certain places! The soundtrack (all of it) is dope!!
gA-5nLQCmW8,Thanks !
gA-5nLQCmW8,soundtrack to this movie was the first ever casset tape i owned. got it for christmas in 1996. I knew every word to every song at age 6. top 5 favorite movies to date

gA-5nLQCmW8,"Save me, White Jesus!"
gA-5nLQCmW8,"Just think: without this movie, there wouldn&#39;t be &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;."
gA-5nLQCmW8,I see that movies
gA-5nLQCmW8,I was 9 years old when the movie came out
gA-5nLQCmW8,How does a United States Marine become a teacher?
gA-5nLQCmW8,I love this movie. Don&#39;t know why there hasn&#39;t been a blu-ray release yet.
gA-5nLQCmW8,Music<br>Eplay
gA-5nLQCmW8,How do I reach these kiiiiids!
gA-5nLQCmW8,<b>HOW CAN I REACH THESE KEEEDS??!!?</b>
gA-5nLQCmW8,Great movie....  these kids need more love and care....  And never give them up..
gA-5nLQCmW8,"1995: &quot;Wow, this was a good movie&quot;<br>2019: &quot;Uhhh..Meow?&quot;"
gA-5nLQCmW8,"This is a classic frfr, helluva movie"
gA-5nLQCmW8,Watched it a very long time ago but I still hate the end of the movie...Emilio wanted to change and because of the cold hearted principal he was murdered!
gA-5nLQCmW8,So like a 90&#39;s Blackboard Jungle?
gA-5nLQCmW8,This movie was based off my school lmfaooooo
gA-5nLQCmW8,Still relevant.
gA-5nLQCmW8,I&#39;m starting running out of white guilt..
gA-5nLQCmW8,Wirklich ausgezeichnet!

gA-5nLQCmW8,I love this movie Michelle  Pfeiffer did her thing👏👏👏👏👏👏
gA-5nLQCmW8,"We had to watch This at elementary school when it came out on vhs, Great drama and soundtrack.<br>It was funny as my school in Norway was so far away from the gangsta life that you could get lol"
gA-5nLQCmW8,beautiful film
gA-5nLQCmW8,"I love this song, but why is there acting in it now?"
gA-5nLQCmW8,So basically sister act 2 but harder
gA-5nLQCmW8,this movie is based on the highschool my mom went to.. she was one of the only white kids and it was baaaaaaad
gA-5nLQCmW8,I don&#39;t get it. Where&#39;s Sonic? :)
15s4Y9ffW_o,"Wow I haven&#39;t seen this film yet , but the trailer has a tinge of the matrix , 5th element demolition man  could see all the films inspirations in the trailer,, I missed allot of films in the 80s / 90s too poor for sky movies, was always on terrestrial TV with the  ten o&#39;clock news slapped in the middle of it,,, you were dead meat if you forgot to press play on the VCR.. 40 this year and proud , love showing old movies to my kids,,"
15s4Y9ffW_o,Underrated movie
15s4Y9ffW_o,The captions 😂
15s4Y9ffW_o,"For all y’all whom likes/love this movie check La Jeteé, the French short movie that inspired this one."
15s4Y9ffW_o,Willis has never won an academy award. He should get something
15s4Y9ffW_o,i&#39;ve seen this movie so many times but this trailer made it seem like a whole different thing from my memory
15s4Y9ffW_o,This movie is a proper mindf**k. Just finished watching it for the first time and I thought it was absolutely great. I love dark movies like this with crazy plot twists and turns and with an ending that leaves everything to be interpreted by the viewers themselves. Great acting too.
15s4Y9ffW_o,This message was almost 25 years old before SARS THE WUHAN PLAGUE PART 1...WAS COVERED UP BY THE SAME CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME BUT WERE DEALT WITH IN A TIMELY FASHION...COVID 19 SARS 2 THE SAME TYPE OF VIRUS SIGNATURE BUT CCP COMPLEX OR THE XI AND FAUCCI CREATE A NEW WUHAN PLANNED BIO-WEAPON...THE W.H.O. HELPED TO SURPRESSING ALL THE DATA AND INFORMATION DESTROYED ABOUT THE SERIOUS POSSIBILITY OF IT&#39;S  EFFECT ON THE HUMAN RACE...
15s4Y9ffW_o,My head is still spinning...
15s4Y9ffW_o,"Interesting but confusing, was glad when it finished. I love time travel films but why didn&#39;t Cole just behave normally when he travelled back in time and try to blend in instead of acting like a loony?"
15s4Y9ffW_o,"&quot;12 Monkeys&quot;(1995) is an excellent dramatic thriller sci-fi movie! The last part of the movie was melancholic,sad, and creepy!"
15s4Y9ffW_o,Love it!
15s4Y9ffW_o,"What a great movie, truly a masterpiece."
15s4Y9ffW_o,"Does the time traveled image at my time travel experiment use the 12 number telephone and its 45-d angle to double circles (paired dimensions), like the repeated Very Specific Hieroglyph, as ....<br><br>A reference to the great fiction The Twelve Monkeys? <br><br>Another indicator of the identity of the receiver, and my government number. Both and it&#39;s another placement of the Very Specific Hieroglyph, or, my symbol. And this was an awesome time travel story, too. 🙂"
15s4Y9ffW_o,I made corona virus

15s4Y9ffW_o,Okay but who&#39;s seen the 2015 series?
15s4Y9ffW_o,one the best romantic films of all time.
15s4Y9ffW_o,"@Movieclips , am I the first person to ask why there are illegitimate closed captions (CC) in the video? AT <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15s4Y9ffW_o&amp;t=1m21s"">1:21</a> it says &quot;Flight 783 for San Francisco is now ready for boarding.&quot;  AT <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15s4Y9ffW_o&amp;t=2m03s"">2:03</a>, the (CC) reads: &quot;Passengers for Rome, come to gate seven.&quot;  - Some kind of conspiracy, then?"
15s4Y9ffW_o,Who knew this was a prophecy in 1995
15s4Y9ffW_o,"<b>Irrefutably a BRILLIANT piece of master filmmaking - my only beef is that Willis has a bit of a &#39;hook&#39; nose, whereas his child self has a dainty little &#39;ski-slope&#39; one</b>"
15s4Y9ffW_o,The soundtrack of Dracula perfectly used.

15s4Y9ffW_o,"A rare film about time travel, which does not present them as a walk, but shows them as a terrible cruel test that only a few can withstand and they do not do it out of great love for art."
15s4Y9ffW_o,one of the best movies I think..
15s4Y9ffW_o,"It was too mish mash, a muddle in the end."
15s4Y9ffW_o,This movie didn’t age well🤦‍♂️

ccq3f9-lQyM,"I really enjoyed the movie. I&#39;ve read biographies on Dora Carrington and Lytton Strachey so it was quite wonderful to see their story on screen. She was obsessed with Lytton, with ultimately tragic consequences."
ccq3f9-lQyM,This movie is just based around q once tomb boy  girl loosing her virginity

qpQ-CnutDy0,"Saw this in IMAX on my 5th grade field trip to the museum of natural history in NYC back in 2004. I just randomly remembered this movie and looked up “Sands of time” and kept getting that Prince of Persia movie, forgot it was “Across the sea of time”. Cool little movie I really liked it as a kid"
qpQ-CnutDy0,"“Wallstreet. Here the Tsars of American industry invest money in the future of the entire country.” Oh my, if it only were so.. Then America could maybe be great and proud again. For everyone’s sake."
qpQ-CnutDy0,There is no streaming option on Roku for the movie. It&#39;s just not there. I never heard of this movie. Looks interesting.
qpQ-CnutDy0,where is donald trump??
qpQ-CnutDy0,"Actually, i prefer this 240p version to Imax.<br>don;t you? : )"

6PKq7YSpO6c,I like this trailer of Olisen twins they bring Rodger and Diana together. Rodger never liked Clarise his girl got adopted
6PKq7YSpO6c,The Olsen twins movie like the parent trap. When Rodger fell in love Clairse she really loves kids like
6PKq7YSpO6c,Wish the olsen twins were young again!💜💙
6PKq7YSpO6c,to be honest i hate the olsen twins
6PKq7YSpO6c,This Reminds me of the parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,My Fav still till this day 😍
6PKq7YSpO6c,"I remember this movie when I was a kid. Movies like this are usually always good but also unrealistic. For example, I highly doubt that the millionaire father would choose Kirstie Alley&#39;s plain jane, baggy t-shirt wearing self over the skinny blonde haired sexy dressing girlfriend. But I guess that&#39;s why this is a movie cuz this doesn&#39;t really happen in real life. But super cute movie"
6PKq7YSpO6c,I remember this movie. Why do people think it&#39;s a parent trap rip off?? This movie is 3 years before that one.
6PKq7YSpO6c,This is like parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,Future   stepmother  was  too  bussy    thats   what  made  movie   wonderful
6PKq7YSpO6c,For some reason I forgot Lindsey Lohan was in the parent trap and I was thinking it was Mary Kate and Ashley in that movie . And I was sitting here thinking like how is this not the parent trap ?? This is the parent trap lol.
6PKq7YSpO6c,"Love their movies so much, especially this one. ❤️"
6PKq7YSpO6c,This is literally just like the parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,The big bad witch... Better than what I would have said
6PKq7YSpO6c,Marykate Olsen Ashley Olsen are my two favorite twin sisters
6PKq7YSpO6c,"No, it does not and nonne has a right to tell another now to live. IT WAS NOT Ashelynn, nor was it Angela (me). It is identity theft"

6PKq7YSpO6c,XD I am only here cause one of my frands said it was filmed at camp miniyowe and indeed it was
6PKq7YSpO6c,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PKq7YSpO6c&amp;t=0m19s"">0:19</a> She was Jessie in The Parent Trap (1998) with Lindsay Lohan, Natasha Richardson, and Dennis Quaid, right?"
6PKq7YSpO6c,It is such a copycat of parent trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,i hate this ewwwww
6PKq7YSpO6c,This what a mixture of Friends and Full House would look like.
6PKq7YSpO6c,this a big ripoff of Parent Trap
6PKq7YSpO6c,Isnt dis like the parent trap?
6PKq7YSpO6c,i had this on VHS and was obsessed with this movie! i still know every line!
6PKq7YSpO6c,the original parent trap was in 1961 the 1998 version was a remake of the 61 original. So yes this move is a copy of it just how Fast and the Furious pretty much copied Point Break
6PKq7YSpO6c,I love the Olsen twins
6PKq7YSpO6c,"Everyone, the parent trap was made AFTER this movie came out"
6PKq7YSpO6c,This movie reminds me of the parent trap. I think the parent trap was way better.
6PKq7YSpO6c,I like Diane in this movie
6PKq7YSpO6c,is it good are bad leave a comment below
6PKq7YSpO6c,yeah and should I watch this movie are nah
6PKq7YSpO6c,love love love LOVE THOSE TWINS SO CUTE AND WHEN THEY WERE ON FULL HOUSE LOVE LOVE THEM leave a comment on my comment if you feel the same way
6PKq7YSpO6c,the old times where everything was good and now there a whores s*** prostitutes
6PKq7YSpO6c,It Takes Two-1995<br>Parent Trap-1998<br>So stop saying that this is a COPY of that movie because it is not.
6PKq7YSpO6c,Taken From The Amazing Panda Adventure 1996 VHS
6PKq7YSpO6c,How did they get away with using this story line without calling it a remake? It&#39;s a blatant copy of the Parent Trap. They must have paid someone to use it. It&#39;s the exact same plot.
6PKq7YSpO6c,parent trap and au pair hybrid
6PKq7YSpO6c,&quot;They&#39;ll have to ditch the big bad witch!&quot; Favorite line in this trailer!
6PKq7YSpO6c,es igual a juego de gemelas omg!
6PKq7YSpO6c,my favourite part in the film is when Amanda rips Clarice&#39;s dress exposing her knickers and stockings with garterbelt (this was later used in Just for laughs veil fail pranks and rugrats in paris movie with better modifications so the whole dress never falls apart)
6PKq7YSpO6c,parent trap?
6PKq7YSpO6c,"This is a very cute movie:) Funny, too! :)"
XuHEa7pWAQY,I must have watched Clueless 10 times.  It never gets old and I love Alicia and Paul Rudd.  The Director was brilliant in casting these 2 actors and the other actors. The whole cast was perfectly chosen.<br>Amy is super talented and so chill and humnled.  I wish she madd more films.

OXc0-EME0C8,Richard III Skeleton 2023
OXc0-EME0C8,Evil Gandalf
OXc0-EME0C8,Makes Sauron look like an amateur :)
OXc0-EME0C8,Please upload youtube 🎥
OXc0-EME0C8,Ian mckellen is a sheksperian genius. I love him in the lord of the rings and the hobbit and so much more but ian mckellen is the king of shekapere and he could play any sheksperian character this actor is such a genius
OXc0-EME0C8,never saw it
OXc0-EME0C8,Excellent.
OXc0-EME0C8,"The interesting of this movie is that it looks modern, but the language spoken is not. And it works wonder well."
OXc0-EME0C8,"The movie may be good (I haven&#39;t seen it), but this trailer looks like unwatchable &#39;90s kitsch."
OXc0-EME0C8,"If you have not seen this film, fix that immediately!"
OXc0-EME0C8,Shakespeare... with tanks!<br>What&#39;s not to love?
OXc0-EME0C8,Holy crap I have been searching for this film forever now I couldn&#39;t remember the name but I saw it in 9th grade twenty years ago and it was so damn memorable but I couldn&#39;t remember the name . This is great just made my day :)
OXc0-EME0C8,&#39;&#39;My kingdom for a jeep&#39;&#39;
OXc0-EME0C8,I wonder if Ian McKellen and Nigel Hawthorn ever dated.
OXc0-EME0C8,BTS V&#39;s insta story rechard 3
OXc0-EME0C8,Looks decent! Anyone know where I can find Richard and Richard 2? Obviously I can’t just watch Richard 3 without seeing the previous films.
OXc0-EME0C8,"Ah, now is the winter of our discount tents made glorious summer by this son of Millets."
OXc0-EME0C8,"Esta película se ve bastante interesante.<br>Además me siento algo representado, ya que tanto mi bisabuelo, como mi abuelo, y mi padre, por parte de mi familia paterna, se llaman o se llamaban Ricardo, y por ello yo vendría siendo, en cierto modo, Ricardo IV.<br>No sería Ricardo III, pero estaría cerca. XD."
OXc0-EME0C8,"There&#39;s an Amazing Australian film like this of MacBeth from 2006<br>They are a Scottish Mob family in Melbourne, the Horsemen are Biker Gang Members, the Witches are Gothic School Girls and the sword fights are Shootouts in the city and tunnels and bushland"
OXc0-EME0C8,Okay this is confusing and completely inaccurate Richard the third lived in 1400
OXc0-EME0C8,Magneto<br>Iron Man <br>Professor McGonagall <br>Professor Horace Slughorn <br>Mar-Vel Captain Marvel former boss and enemy
OXc0-EME0C8,"For anyone looking for the music that starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc0-EME0C8&amp;t=1m52s"">1:52</a>, it&#39;s Belshazzar&#39;s Feast &#39;Then Sing Aloud to God&#39;. (The version in the trailer is edited a bit, though.)"
OXc0-EME0C8,Robert hahahah perfect
OXc0-EME0C8,A cheesy commercial for a brilliant film....
OXc0-EME0C8,The trailer makes it look like they wanted this to be shown as a double feature together with Die Hard 3.
OXc0-EME0C8,"Near the end, when King Richard&#39;s jeep gets stuck in the mud and soldiers on horseback ride on past , he cries out &quot;A horse,  a horse, my kingdom for a horse...&quot;"
OXc0-EME0C8,"I distinctly remember coming home one night in 1997, turning on the TV and stumbling upon this film. It was the scene in the morgue where Ian McKellen talks to Kristin Scott Thomas. I was utterly amazed with this masterpiece of cinematography and it is still one of my favorite ones."
OXc0-EME0C8,1984?
OXc0-EME0C8,IS LIKE TITUS And romeo  and juliet.
OXc0-EME0C8,Of course they have to make it about Nazis. Might as well call it Edward VIII.. lol
OXc0-EME0C8,B
OXc0-EME0C8,maggie smith- hasn&#39;t aged a day.
OXc0-EME0C8,"What song is that at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc0-EME0C8&amp;t=1m52s"">1:52</a>"
OXc0-EME0C8,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc0-EME0C8&amp;t=0m50s"">0:50</a> Stop! Is Iron Man yelling at Magnito?"
OXc0-EME0C8,Between this and the Hopkins version of “Titus”. It’s hard to say what my favorite Shakespeare adaptation is. Both are great.
OXc0-EME0C8,I like his wild boar.
OXc0-EME0C8,How many killings?
OXc0-EME0C8,"This movie is a horrible presentation of a William Shakespeare play.<br>Shakespeare died in 1616<br>and wrote a story of a king in 1483. <br>YET the costumes are 1940 fashion and the characters are driving in cars not invented until the 1900&#39;s<br> Meanwhile, the vocals are not only spoken in Shakespeare&#39;s horrid  stage-play style of poetry writing (I&#39;ll never understand why people like that) BUT the vocals are not recorded well so inaudible most of the time ranging from mumbles to screetches.  Meanwhile, the background music is so loud its deafening.<br>If the director was aiming for a modern theme on a story of ancient history, such as has been done with the fictional story of Romeo &amp; Juliet (Leonardo DiCaprio), it doesn&#39;t work here because this is actual history and shouldnt be &#39;time altered&#39;.<br>Great cast of actors in a horrible movie."
OXc0-EME0C8,"This looks fucking retarded.  Great job, Hollywood jews!"
OXc0-EME0C8,richard 3 reich
OXc0-EME0C8,"At the beginning, the narrator sounded it like a bond film"
OXc0-EME0C8,Never mock your Royal Children only correct them!
OXc0-EME0C8,Man Richard the lionheart was a man guy.
OXc0-EME0C8,Excellent!
OXc0-EME0C8,"i love the ending, where he shoots his own man through the brain, then leaps into an inferno laughing his head off while a jazzy upbeat Al Jolson track kicks off! <br><br>a fantastic wicked villain"
OXc0-EME0C8,MAGNIFICA
OXc0-EME0C8,"A movie ahead of its time with many important stories from what happened during the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th century with some liberty here and there, some dark humor, excellent choice of actors . They don&#39;t make movies like this anymore . ( wow Maggie Smith looked old back then still in Downtown Abbey show she looks the same strange ?? )"
OXc0-EME0C8,What the fuck is this?
OXc0-EME0C8,Richard the turd.
OXc0-EME0C8,Everyone complains about spoilers in modern day trailers yet this one spoils a ton of the film lol.
OXc0-EME0C8,this looks epic. cannot believe that I did not see this.
OXc0-EME0C8,so metal...
OXc0-EME0C8,"Actually, for a movie that good, the trailer is rather unpalatable and perhaps misleading..."
OXc0-EME0C8,Frank Underwood is based off of Richard
OXc0-EME0C8,"What the hell is this? I expected a 15th Century historical representation of Richard III. This looks like a mid-Twentieth Century iteration of the Shakespearean play, which by the way is not historically accurate, because of political considerations concerning the Tudor dynasty."
OXc0-EME0C8,never thought i&#39;d see richard III as hitler..
OXc0-EME0C8,As it has never been told before? It&#39;s a pretty old play. it&#39;s been told exactly this way for centuries.
OXc0-EME0C8,And Englands flag at the time was The three lions of England on a red backround and the fluer de lis of France against a blue backround on a qaurtred flag
OXc0-EME0C8,This is Richard III of England right who ruled in late medieval times and was not a Nazi and existed 450 years before Hitlers rise
OXc0-EME0C8,God bless us and to our family!!!
OXc0-EME0C8,Your brain fu-ked. Your brain off. What is the culture? Nothing.
OXc0-EME0C8,"I really don&#39;t know what to make of the film.  Some of it is absolutely sublime -- the transposition to a totalitarian state is brilliant and conveys to the modern audience exactly how chilling Shakespeare meant the rise of Richard III to be, lying, cheating and murdering his way to the top, all the while managing to convince everyone -- from the women he seduces to the confederates he first wins to his cause and then betrays and has slaughtered when he has no further need of them -- that he is their ally.   Unlike so many &quot;modern&quot; versions of Shakespeare, it is completely on point.<br><br>On the other hand, they have certainly taken some liberties with the story.  Richmond waking before the battle and saying he has enjoyed the sweetest sleep ever conveys the impression that this is because he has enjoyed some great sex beforehand (and is about to enjoy some more), rather than having had the ghosts of all of Richard&#39;s victims wishing him success in his dreams, which is a pretty key point of Shakespeare&#39;s version.  And Queen Margaret&#39;s oh-so-prophetic curse at the beginning of the play has been lost.<br><br>Still, the gamble certainly pays off -- and once again (as he did with &quot;Macbeth&quot;), Sir Ian is absolutely perfect in the role."
OXc0-EME0C8,I have only seen parts of this film but Ian McKellen gave a phenomenal performance as the controversial York king. One of these days I am going to watch this from start to finish. The cast is just GREAT!!!
OXc0-EME0C8,"ach ihr briten , das böse am briten ist halt deutsch , gell . drum heissen sie auch haus windsor und nicht mehr haus hanover ."
OXc0-EME0C8,A fantastic adaption!
OXc0-EME0C8,"The true monster is the length of the drama, making it as hard as possible to finish shortly before a test. That&#39;s actually the real meaning of it. Also, Shakespeare is ennervating with his damn over-the-top passion. That&#39;s fine in your leisure, but not necessarily in a serious context..."
OXc0-EME0C8,Magneto vs Iron Man
OXc0-EME0C8,I didn&#39;t know that Professor McGonnagall had a son called Gandalf.
OXc0-EME0C8,Great playwright. I still think Macbeth is a better villian lol XD
OXc0-EME0C8,A blu-ray release would be nice...
OXc0-EME0C8,"God, it&#39;s like the narrator can&#39;t decide if he&#39;s doing an American or British accent."
OXc0-EME0C8,I fucking love this film but this trailer is just so... urgh
OXc0-EME0C8,This movie made Richard III into one of my heroes.  It also has one of the greatest seduction scenes in all of film.
OXc0-EME0C8,"Absolutely one of my all-time favourites. Saw it many times, still have to get the DVD. Superbly filmed, a brilliant cast, and the way they incorporated some of the landmark buildings in the story is really great. Ian McKellen is pure evil in this and boy, does he do a good job at being evil."
OXc0-EME0C8,I love Laurence Olivier&#39;s version but wow this looks cool!
OXc0-EME0C8,what is the name of the song near the end
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Who is here watching Restoration as an assignment lol ?
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Why is everyone plastered in Hollywood makeup in these effing dramas.
CvsAuHYBgEQ,To adopt myself to the life under Charles III I bet will have to force myself watching this...
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"Iron Man, Lupin, Gandalf and Palpatine before they were all famous..."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"They looked so clean back then, considering nobody showered."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,sooo they just used the soundtrack from Mission for their trailer?
CvsAuHYBgEQ,The first ever Robert Downey Jr movie I watched ❤️.
CvsAuHYBgEQ,and their careers... like kaleo.... way down they go
CvsAuHYBgEQ,an ideal waste of robbery aplenty...
CvsAuHYBgEQ,in reverse... lol... a crockery.... lol
CvsAuHYBgEQ,La banda sonora es un solemne plagio de la compuesta por Ennio Morricone para la Misión de Roland Joffé
CvsAuHYBgEQ,This is a wonderful film.
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Imagine all these royals were Black... 🤔
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"turns 25!<br>Big cast of Robert Downey, Jr., Sam Neill, Ian McKellen, Hugh Grant, Ian McDiarmid, Meg Ryan, and David Thewlis.<br>The costumes and the art direction are spot-on. They got every detail of the 17th century with the outfits, the architecture, the gold colors of furniture, jewelry, and wealth. <br>Goes on longer than it should but it&#39;s a gorgeous looking film with magnificent colors and elegant music. <br>Everyone gives it their all."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,I love how they used to do the cheesy narration in the movie trailers in the 90’s and it was always the same two dudes. It always seemed to start with “in a land” or “in a world” 😂😂😂
CvsAuHYBgEQ,&quot;Restoration&quot; has a wonderful soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard. Who had the bizarre idea of using Morricone&#39;s The Mission [btw also wonderful] here? 👀👀👀
CvsAuHYBgEQ,I remember watching this when i was in third grade . Didnt understand a thing. Well gonna watch it one more time
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"We reviewed this for our Hugh Grant podcast called &#39;Taking Hugh for Granted&#39;, look it up and check it out if you&#39;re interested! We talk about this bizarre film, Hugh&#39;s role in it and his potential spats with Robert Downey Jr and Sir Ian McKellen!"
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"So this movie is real!?<br>I had a vague memory about it, but I thought it was a parody or some sort."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Loved 👍😍🤩🏆😎❤💋🎬🥰👈👌💋❤❤😎❤iron man robert Downey jr. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😎❤😎🏆🤩😍👍
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"No wonder the film failed at the box office... The trailer is pathetic. I remember enjoying watching it, though."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Why have I never heard of this movie??
CvsAuHYBgEQ,This king (Charles II)  is known as the biggest womanizer in Royal history
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Are there any other movies other than this from the 80&#39;s 90&#39;s or 2000
CvsAuHYBgEQ,This video should have an age restriction
CvsAuHYBgEQ,I have now ordered the film. Because Robert is playing with it.❤
CvsAuHYBgEQ,why do they show so much nudity in Hollywood movies...? could never understand...
CvsAuHYBgEQ,I have fallen in love with my wife...RDJ is romance......
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Not as good as Horrible Histories
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"One of my favourite movies! This trailer, while full of nostalgia, doesn&#39;t do the movie justice. Both the movie and novel it is based on are amazing. This was one of Robert Downey&#39;s best performances. The cast is also amazing, they didn&#39;t show Ian McKellen and Ian McDiarmid...aka Gandalf name and Palpatine..."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"I&#39;m seeing an awful lot of RDJ in this trailer. Like, a lot."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,This looks awful.  This trailer leaves me feeling peculiar.
CvsAuHYBgEQ,So... Wow. Don&#39;t know if I should watch this movie
CvsAuHYBgEQ,There must always be a Stark in Winterfell
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Does anyone know the name of the music in the begin?
CvsAuHYBgEQ,&#39;In a world...&#39;
CvsAuHYBgEQ,I almost threw up 🤢
CvsAuHYBgEQ,American actors on british accent. Cool!
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"RDJ, Meg Ryan and Hugh Grant? Why have I never seen this before??"
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"Oh right, RDJ was an actor."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"oh, look at Wolsey from The Thudors xDDDDDD."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Terrific film!
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Wtf
CvsAuHYBgEQ,its ok
CvsAuHYBgEQ,I LOVE THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE LOVE ME<br>SO MUCH THAT THEY RESTORED THE ENGLISH MONARCHY
CvsAuHYBgEQ,He looks good with lipstick
CvsAuHYBgEQ,I like to write My dream is to write a movie scenario Like dreams become real I can sell the script of the movie I have written This is my address Hastin Nuraini Jalan Lilin Mas 6 Dadaprejo Junrejo Batu East Java Indonesia Tel: 6281334887683 I also want to have a role as a certain character of the story that I write thank you
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"Starring Robert Downey Jr., Meg Ryan , David Thewlis , Hugh Grant and the guy from Jurrasic Park 😂"
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"What is the music used at the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvsAuHYBgEQ&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a>? I am not sure if it was actually used in the film."
CvsAuHYBgEQ,"Agradezco la información de esta película, y otras que me envia por mail, pero si no son subtituladas , oh en Español Latino, imposible verlas, desde ya le agradezco su buena voluntad. gracias--------"
CvsAuHYBgEQ,Sam Neill was very good in this
CvsAuHYBgEQ,What the hell is this movie😂
CvsAuHYBgEQ,😻📺👍!
JHIfHL5UgFs,Want to touch the hiney
JHIfHL5UgFs,This movie is awesome and badass
JHIfHL5UgFs,Goosebumps. Fr.

JHIfHL5UgFs,"Amazing SNES game, amazing movie, amazing song."
JHIfHL5UgFs,Why are there dying voice sounds from the Goldeneye 007 game in this trailer? I know this movie was before the game 😂
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Despite being PG-13, the movie did serve a bit of justice for the MK fans, like how Liu Kang actually used the bicycle kick on Reptile and also using his fireball on Shang Tsung to defeat them just like in the games. Then with the intense battle with Johnny Cage and Scorpion, Johnny had given him a finishing blow in which it was considered a fatality. It was a great effort for the makers of this film. Even Ed Boon was satisfied for what it came out to be."
JHIfHL5UgFs,esse foi o primeiro filme pirata que baixei
JHIfHL5UgFs,Mortal kombat 1 street fighter 0
JHIfHL5UgFs,I had anxiety attacks waiting for this movie to show on open tv
JHIfHL5UgFs,"The movie should not have come out until 2010! Why?! Better CGI , more creativity , new writer , new director , and new producers!<br><br>Personally if I had it my way<br><br>1. Written and Directed by Paul WS Anderson<br><br>2. Produced by Michael Bay Andrew Form Brad Fuller Paul WS Anderson and Todd McFarlane<br><br>3.

JHIfHL5UgFs,"Lol! This was my favourite movie as a kid, I remember renting it all the time from the video store on VHS. Just made my kids watch it this weekend and they loved it😂"
JHIfHL5UgFs,Best action-fantasy film in 90Th
JHIfHL5UgFs,Kano<br>Liu Kang<br>Raiden<br>Johnny cage<br>Scorpion <br>Sub-Zero<br>Sonya
JHIfHL5UgFs,I think the reason this movie (as well as it’s sequel) was rated PG-13 was because the blood and gore of the games (especially the Fatalities) weren’t necessarily canon to the Mortal Kombat lore at the time.
JHIfHL5UgFs,That thumbnail tells me this is some erotic romance story.
JHIfHL5UgFs,Still better than the 2021 movie.
JHIfHL5UgFs,"This movie was half cool half trash when it came out. Little we knew it was going to be the best adaptation of MK, before they turned it into a PG13 fantasy saga and Scorpion into a hobo."
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Ностальгия. Помню с братьями у бабушки дома, всю ночь ждали премьеру фильма по ТВ."
JHIfHL5UgFs,it is all in all adrenaline rush..BOOM!!!!
JHIfHL5UgFs,So Shane sung you won&#39;t forget me and nobility
JHIfHL5UgFs,"i was 10 years old when this movie came out was already and big mk game fan,  i remember seeing this trailer, man i was blown away, this movie was better than the 2021 movie hands down."
JHIfHL5UgFs,"i was only disappointed with 1 thing, the main villain was saying all the game phrases but in reality the voice of Goro fits those phrases the best"
JHIfHL5UgFs,"If anyone wants to feel like they living the 90s again, watch this trailer"
JHIfHL5UgFs,Se ve buenísimo 😂😂
JHIfHL5UgFs,From what I hear this trailer is better than the entire new movie
JHIfHL5UgFs,ALL.   MORTAL. KOMBAT.    PART.   2.
JHIfHL5UgFs,😎🕷🐉🦘🐧🐻‍❄️🐆
JHIfHL5UgFs,My Third Childhood movie
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Grew up playin the game, early 80’s baby so I was on neting Mortal Kombat in my youth, saw it with my now deceased sister, was like 11-12 when it came out, hype AF to see it in Queens and left satisfied, I wanted to see Jax but he wasn’t really in it but still was happy"
JHIfHL5UgFs,"First time seeing the trailer, l binged on this movie at the Video Club"
JHIfHL5UgFs,No mortal kombat movie beats this movie !!!
JHIfHL5UgFs,Mortal Kombat is based on Mortal Kombat Deception
JHIfHL5UgFs,this trailer still bangs
JHIfHL5UgFs,man i miss these days
JHIfHL5UgFs,This movie was everything to me as a kid. Was obsessed with it and the games.
JHIfHL5UgFs,Yeah still rocks ….2022
JHIfHL5UgFs,"THE BEST PART <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHIfHL5UgFs&amp;t=0m58s"">0:58</a>"
JHIfHL5UgFs,Still the GOAT Live Action ever
JHIfHL5UgFs,As a 90&#39;s kid and having bought MK3 that same year I was obsessed with this movie...
JHIfHL5UgFs,If only this cast would have cameos in the MK Reboot
JHIfHL5UgFs,This was a really good video game movie…the trailer was awesome! The sequel was atrocious lol
JHIfHL5UgFs,The best part of this film....was the trailer.
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Veikko aka Son Go Q, Infos die die Welt nicht braucht, Dummschwätzer 😂"
JHIfHL5UgFs,"One of my favorite movies, but this trailer does not make it justice"
JHIfHL5UgFs,I&#39;m so pumped up  for this movie man 💪💪💪
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Still the best video game adaptation movie to this day, even more than the recent attempt to reboot this franchise as a movie<br>No better time to  replicate the Mortal Kombat game of the 90&#39;s with the spirit of action/fantasy/martial arts movie of the 90&#39;s"
JHIfHL5UgFs,캐치온에서 모탈컴벳 있어서 이전 모탈컴벳인줄 알고 보는데 전혀 틀려서 찾아보니 2021년작이네요..  갠적으론  아날로그적인 연출과 함께 배우들의 액션이 복고풍 테크노 음악과 훌륭히 잘 어우러진 지금 이 영상속 1995년작이 더 나은것 같네요 영상 감사히 잘 보고 갑니다~~
JHIfHL5UgFs,I don’t need to run!
JHIfHL5UgFs,At work and the theme song just popped in my head so I just had to watch it again at 40 I still remember being 13 Watchung this being so hype..The recent one was ok..The recent one trailer tho was better than the movie hands down
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Nostálgico, já faltei aula pra ver esse filme"
JHIfHL5UgFs,Still my favorite video game movie.
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Wiat, you&#39;re saying this movie really isn&#39;t a comedy?"
JHIfHL5UgFs,I❤ Movies Based On Video Games.
JHIfHL5UgFs,still a kickass trailer
JHIfHL5UgFs,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHIfHL5UgFs&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHIfHL5UgFs&amp;t=1m34s"">1:34</a><br>Kano🔪... Liu Kang🔥... Raiden⚡... Johnny Cage🎬... Scorpion💀... Sub-Zero🧊... Sonya🔫... MORTAL KOMBAT!!!"
JHIfHL5UgFs,Oh the 90s where fire 💯
JHIfHL5UgFs,Kool
JHIfHL5UgFs,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHIfHL5UgFs&amp;t=0m37s"">0:37</a> Anything else? 🤣😂"
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Mortal Kombat 1995 was good, theme was great, effects were good for its it&#39;s time. <br>Mortal Kombat sequel was trash.<br>Mortal Kombat 2021 had some good visuals but other than kano the movie sucked, not as bad as the sequel but it was just terrible."
JHIfHL5UgFs,I feel like the barber in coming to America because my friends hate this movie and im always like god dang this is good.
JHIfHL5UgFs,I want these days back so bad
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Yuing Yung 6 Creation Of Light &amp; Darkness , Keepers Fighters Of Most Important In Creation                        - Lui Kang ........... Rayden - Destiny White !!      - = M = - Maxim Ben David"

JHIfHL5UgFs,This was a PG-13 film before became red R
JHIfHL5UgFs,👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
JHIfHL5UgFs,Mortal Kombat (1995) is Rated PG-13 in orange.
JHIfHL5UgFs,This handsdown the besy video game base movies and the soundtrack still stir up my kid emotion.
JHIfHL5UgFs,"When they show Scorpion after saying his name, they show him in reverse; the creature comes out of his right hand, but they show him aiming his left hand."
JHIfHL5UgFs,"This movie is definitely more faithful to the game, though there were differences. The characters stand out better. Tsang Sung and Lui Kang have better casting. Still the best Mortal Kombat movie."
JHIfHL5UgFs,Cool movie trailer
JHIfHL5UgFs,"i remember seeing this movie in theaters with my family and and going back home and to school talking about how INSANE <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHIfHL5UgFs&amp;t=1m10s"">1:10</a> was"
JHIfHL5UgFs,"The Mortal Kombat we all deserved, but were not ready for!!"
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Best MK ever, far above that 2021 bullshit, no matter that the special effects lack."
JHIfHL5UgFs,RIP Art Lean
JHIfHL5UgFs,"Oh man this trailer is so steeped in 90s style. But of course, chills down the spine the moment the MK theme comes on."
JHIfHL5UgFs,This movie aged really good
JHIfHL5UgFs,Tune doesn&#39;t get old
JHIfHL5UgFs,So much for
JHIfHL5UgFs,Kano Liu Kang Raiden Johnny Cage Scorpion Sub-Zero Sonya And Goro! (Roaring)<br>Mortal Kombat!
JHIfHL5UgFs,😂
JHIfHL5UgFs,After all these years…. Sonja/Veronica Vaughan still gets me hot and hard
JHIfHL5UgFs,Christ you know how many times I saw this before Dumb &amp; Dumber on VHS? Too many. This trailer is ingrained in my soul. Definitely a banger.
JHIfHL5UgFs,Hands down one of the best movies EVER!!!
JHIfHL5UgFs,Good
JHIfHL5UgFs,best CGI of all time!
JHIfHL5UgFs,P cari orang indo
JHIfHL5UgFs,Still better than the new one...plus they are in  the actual game for a reason. Thank you Mk11
JHIfHL5UgFs,The movie that made my movie
JHIfHL5UgFs,We need more from Bridgette Wilson!
JHIfHL5UgFs,"If you were there for this initial trailer, you&#39;re a real one."
JHIfHL5UgFs,Still better than the remake.
JHIfHL5UgFs,This was and still is better than new MK
JHIfHL5UgFs,4 kano 333-333-333
JHIfHL5UgFs,Like phrases
JHIfHL5UgFs,Love this one better u can’t run from me I don’t need to run
JHIfHL5UgFs,There world is ours
JHIfHL5UgFs,You can’t run from me I don’t need to run scorpion sub cero your soul is mine
JHIfHL5UgFs,Awesome.
JHIfHL5UgFs,I want to learn that awesome MOVE where Subzero appears to be doing a back handspring layout but holds it mid-air.
Y1uPXA1ceNo,6/20🍆🥕🍓🍊
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Nicole Kidman was robbed of an Oscar nomination for this brilliant performance.  This is pretty much the Pamela Smart story.  Nicole did NOT deserve an Oscar for The Hours.  That was bull.
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Nicole Kidman won a golden globe for her performance in To Die For why was she nominated for an oscar? She finally won an oscar in the hours in 2003 she was overdue for one anyways! She was great in this flim since it was based on the Pamela Smart case*<b>*</b>
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"Joaquin Phoenix 2 years after his bro death starting to show us how talented actor is, like his late bro River...! Good movie with great actors."
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"Would&#39;ve been fitting justice, if 3 other lives hadn&#39;t been destroyed in the process"
Y1uPXA1ceNo,now sound on this video.
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"I agree, that she should have won an Oscar, this was a great movie and I love the way she played her role, its was fantastic. she was so hot, without getting totally nude. Just her expression was what made it work."
Y1uPXA1ceNo,this was her best movie and got her well known in the states
Y1uPXA1ceNo,It&#39;s such a bummer the audio is muted. I really want to hear her say &quot;tomorrow it&#39;s going to be HOT&quot; when she tosses the sun on the weather map. Van Sant said that wasn&#39;t planned.
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"in this role she is really hot , however is great performance 
"
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Well  i  first  saw  her  in  this  and  i was in  the  UK  at  the  time  thanks  for  the  reply!
Y1uPXA1ceNo,American film debut? The first one was Days Of Thunder in 1990.
Y1uPXA1ceNo,oh  yes! well  said  she&#39;s  a  total  sociopath  in this  one  and  does  a  great  performance i  believe  it&#39;s  KIDMAN&#39;S  American  film  debut  and  you  see  a  young  JOAQUIN  PHOENIX  in  this  as   well!!
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"she plays a role of a narcissic pervert very crazy, scaring and good interpretation "
Y1uPXA1ceNo,She&#39;s even prettier in practical magic
Y1uPXA1ceNo,the story this is based off happened at the school i go to
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"pretty much
"
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Nicole Kidman looks so fabulous :))
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Am I the only one who thinks that Matt Dillon and Joaquin Phoenix kinda look alike?
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"I just saw this recently, it&#39;s a gem. Joaquin and Casey &lt;3"
Y1uPXA1ceNo,nicole kidman was soo sexy in this film
Y1uPXA1ceNo,omg joaquin!!!
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"This really did happen check out the Pam Smart story,that&#39;s what this was based on."
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"Matt Dillon &lt;3
"
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"@SuperJayZFan1 Yeah it is, and I´m serious"
Y1uPXA1ceNo,I LOVE THIS MOVIE NICOLE KIDMAN IS SO HOT IN THIS MOVIE :)
Y1uPXA1ceNo,this is the Nicole Kidman i love :&quot;&gt;
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Joaquin Phoenix =)
Y1uPXA1ceNo,she&#39;s so damned good looking in this role. 
Y1uPXA1ceNo,nicole kidman is such a babe!
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"Kidman should have at least been nominated for an oscar for this role. She won several major awards from the critics, a golden globe and was nominated for a British academy award. I think hollywood thought she hadnt paid her dues so to speak, that she had married a hollywood superstar and had had it too easy."
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Nicole Kidman&#39;s greatest role.
Y1uPXA1ceNo,"just watched this on E! tonight for the first time in a long time. what a great movie! nicole is fantastic in it. she deserved an oscar. joaquin got my blood boiling, too... i forgot just how much i love him. sooo sexy! lol..."
Y1uPXA1ceNo,Love this movie. Nic is so mean in it! haha So the oposite of what she&#39;s like in real life. She&#39;s the BEST ♥
K5_2VgJUSBA,Zero stars how the fuck so i make a quilt

K5_2VgJUSBA,J&#39;adore
K5_2VgJUSBA,Is it on Netflix south Africa
K5_2VgJUSBA,Monogamy is very natural.  It’s the right thing to do.
K5_2VgJUSBA,This looks like a prequel of Yaya sisterhood.
K5_2VgJUSBA,Will Estes is in this movie. He played the boy at the party.
K5_2VgJUSBA,Samantha mathis is the best in this film
K5_2VgJUSBA,"Whoops, I was looking for border security."
K5_2VgJUSBA,"had this movie on VHS. The good &quot;old times&quot; when movies were actually good, before the whole world went to insanity hell."
K5_2VgJUSBA,Daddys home 🐎🐎🐎🐎💨💨💨💨💨
K5_2VgJUSBA,Most of the characters are terrible people
K5_2VgJUSBA,I love this movie. Watching it again.
K5_2VgJUSBA,"This is a sensitively-wrought American movie, and I think it reflects our society&#39;s appreciation for humanism-oriented &#39;lifestyle writers&#39; such as Barbara Kingsolver, Emily Dickinson, and Edith Wharton; and of course film-makers like Penny Marshall and Sofia Coppola. There&#39;s always room for diarism in storytelling, since of course, that&#39;s why we appreciate sensitivity-decadent male writers/film-makers such as Dean Koontz and Ang Lee..."
K5_2VgJUSBA,Dónde se consigue en español?
K5_2VgJUSBA,Hermosa película! Y los amores ... si son eternos...
K5_2VgJUSBA,"Something, I don&#39;t understand American girl.  why she cheating on her engage man is a little thing that she easy to forget!! and  I had her because she no honest, no control. In long way latter she will do this cheating again!!! It not good"
K5_2VgJUSBA,"Its Shart, sophisticated art"
K5_2VgJUSBA,God i love this movie so much
K5_2VgJUSBA,Where can this movie be purchased on Blueray?
K5_2VgJUSBA,i miss old trailers
K5_2VgJUSBA,About to check this out on Netflix.
K5_2VgJUSBA,Wonderful movie that seems to have vanished. And boy Winona Ryder sure was adorable.
K5_2VgJUSBA,Sweet movie. People should really give credit to movies like these. Movies that don&#39;t warp your mind and turn people into psychos.

SpKbZ_3zlb0,Mohtewem film
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Why can&#39;t all movies be this damn good
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"Increible ver lo mal que ha envejecido el trailer y lo vigente que sigue la pelicula, como si el tiempo no le pasara, a 25 años de esta joya pareciera que se hizo ayer. <br>El mejor thriller policiaco de la historia."
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Glad they don’t use voice over anymore
SpKbZ_3zlb0,.7.  Al. Bertha. Locust 700.  HoTT 💉 USED lol 😂 I&#39;m a Crow 🤣 🐝🍯.  KING 👑. Angel 😇
SpKbZ_3zlb0,902
SpKbZ_3zlb0,The casting alone sells you let alone the plot. They were so good in it and together. Creepy from the beginning thru the last frame.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"i heard this movie is good, quite cheap to rent this for 7 days in HD"
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"This guy’s methodical…….exacting………,and worst of all……………………..PATIENT!!!!!!"
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"1995!!   I saw this movie, &quot;it&#39;s good&quot;... 😂"
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"Από τέτοιες ταινιάρες, μια φορά και έναν καιρό, πως κατάντησε στα καζινα?"
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"The world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.<br><br>Ernest Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls"
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Still one of my very favourite movies of all time!!!
SpKbZ_3zlb0,I got to make time to watch this flick.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Pretty sure if this movie was made this year everyone in the comments would&#39;ve spoiled bout the ending 🤣
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Silly
SpKbZ_3zlb0,David Fincher&#39;s greatest films:<br><br>Se7en<br>The Game<br>Fight Club <br>Panic Room<br>Zodiac<br>The girl with the dragon tattoo <br>Gone Girl
SpKbZ_3zlb0,1995 :<br>Se7en<br>The Usual Suspects<br>Heat<br>Die Hard with a Vengeance<br>12 Monkeys<br>GoldenEye<br>Casino<br><br>What a great year for thriller
SpKbZ_3zlb0,They DO NOT make movies like this anymore!
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Have you ever seen anything like this?
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Nice quality for modern age which is now
SpKbZ_3zlb0,I love this movie in theaters. I was only 9 yrs old. This definitely give Bone Collector &amp; Silence of the lamb a run.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"Gran peli, gracias🎞️🎥🍿🎬"
SpKbZ_3zlb0,There is no better serial killer movie than this.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,&quot;Is it true that Dinsdale nailed your wife&#39;s head to a coffee table?&quot;<br>-Monty Python
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Great film and restoration but trailer sucks. Captures none of the mood of the real film.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,This is probably the best crime thriller movie of all time!The movie&#39;s ending is the most shocking and disturbing at the movie in history of cinema!
SpKbZ_3zlb0,John Do spricht politisch
SpKbZ_3zlb0,One of the most important  movies EVER  made.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,I know what’s in the box and it’s a candle smells like Gwyneth’s Vajayay.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,I&#39;m scaring myself.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Back when trailers didn&#39;t give away 3/4s of the movie.  Spacey was a big star at the time and he&#39;s not even shown in the trailer.  I didn&#39;t even know he was in the movie when I first saw it.  Hollywood would never have the balls to do this today.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,The story is straight from Batman:year one comic. Sort of.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"I saw the movie and the cinematography didn&#39;t look at all like it was made in the 90s. It impressed me how it looked so much like it was filmed in the 2000s or even the 2010s. I don&#39;t know how they did it, but it&#39;s incredible."
SpKbZ_3zlb0,I just got this at a goodwill for a dollar I&#39;m sure I&#39;m in for a treat because I&#39;ve heard so many things about this
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Who else came here because of the new Batman teaser
SpKbZ_3zlb0,I’m here after people cuz so many people were comparing the Batman to it!
SpKbZ_3zlb0,The new batman movie seems heavily inspired from Se7en. Just look at the whole vibe of that trailer. Amazing
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Hindi me kaaha he
SpKbZ_3zlb0,masterpiece. #4 of my all-time favorite movie
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Is like a classic film noir movies are.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Where can i get to see the full movie.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,2019 ??
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Wonderful
SpKbZ_3zlb0,I watched this on Netflix a few months ago. I still can&#39;t get over the Sloth victim. That scene still gives me chills until now.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Love this movie. Love how modernized the trailer looks.
SpKbZ_3zlb0,"Very good trailer,,, It baits you in,,, and It doesn&#39;t spoil the movie ..well done ..."
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Deal...lol😘😘😘😘😘😘
SpKbZ_3zlb0,Awesome work!
SpKbZ_3zlb0,What&#39;s In The Box
SpKbZ_3zlb0,This is great! I was wondering if they had ever remastered it from the 1995 footage! Looks great in HD!

oiXdPolca5w,What a trailer!!
oiXdPolca5w,"RM Same old scene, usual deception"
oiXdPolca5w,Thanks to Palmemtieri.
oiXdPolca5w,Greatest mystery thriller of all time
oiXdPolca5w,"<b>SPOILER ALERT</b><br>I watched this movie with my mom once. We both love mysteries and she told me this movie was one of her favorites so we sat down to watch it, and within 5 minutes I turned to her and said, &quot;it&#39;s him, its kevin spacey right?.&quot; <br>She just looked at me in shock with her jaw dropped and said, &quot;how the hell did you know that?.&quot;<br>I told her, &quot;it&#39;s always the one you least expect.&quot; <br>She couldn&#39;t believe it. <br>Good times 🤣"
oiXdPolca5w,His name was CAT BRANCHMAN
oiXdPolca5w,⭐⭐⭐⭐Must Watch
oiXdPolca5w,is it just me or anyone else thought that kint was soze from start
oiXdPolca5w,One of the best movies - and endings - ever made.... a masterpiece of story telling
oiXdPolca5w,This is like by far the greatest movie ever...
oiXdPolca5w,Whos shit
oiXdPolca5w,"So much atmosphere tension, dock scenes fabulous,acting at its very best."
oiXdPolca5w,That narrator&#39;s voice was nostalgic.
oiXdPolca5w,It&#39;s a shame that director turned out to be a pedo...and that story of Kevin Spacey on set. Man...Bryan Singer and Kevin Spacey 2 talents with some horrifying pasts
oiXdPolca5w,"Together with Black Panther, this is another overrated movie."
oiXdPolca5w,Bollywood tried to copy this one too🤣🤣🤣
oiXdPolca5w,10/10
oiXdPolca5w,"Seems like everyone had this movie spoiled one way or another. I got it spoiled when i walked into the living room where my grandpa was watching it and TV was playing the last few minutes of the movie. I didn&#39;t think about it or care, but years later i was watching the movie and immediately remembered the scene and realized it was from the end. I realized what the twist was. Still enjoyed it, great movie. They don&#39;t make them like this anymore. 90&#39;s had some great thrillers. Like The Game and 7even."
oiXdPolca5w,"I&#39;ve had plenty of films spoiled for me in my time, but this is the only movie I&#39;ve ever been actively angry about having spoiled. Once it&#39;s spoiled, it&#39;s impossible to forget. A brilliant ending"
oiXdPolca5w,Kevin spacey is k…. S…… for those who came for trailer 🥺
oiXdPolca5w,you know what would have been a great ending (I don&#39;t hate the actual ending this is just my opinion ) <br>the cripple  guy walk out of the police station and got into a taxi then the taxi blows up not far from the  police station ...so at the final time the police thought that kaiser soze is that oldish guy with a lawyer girl friend so the cripple dyeing in a taxi they will fig it was him ...he finally killed him for some reason and they would close the case on  the cripple guy ...after that he will walk free with out no search on his back from the cops ...<br>&#39; The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn`t exist&quot;  Right ????😅
oiXdPolca5w,This movie is the biggest mindfuck ever.
oiXdPolca5w,Lots of people do believe the devil exists!  If only &quot;he&quot; didn&#39;t!
oiXdPolca5w,"Just saw this movie, no one could have predicted the ending"
oiXdPolca5w,"And he showed those Men of Will, what WILL really was!"
oiXdPolca5w,sucks that i got spoiled who keyser soze is when i didnt even know the name of this movie.
oiXdPolca5w,I’m very open minded when it comes to movies / genres etc <br>But I see no redeeming qualities in this movie at all whatsoever…. It was boring and pointless - plain and simple !
oiXdPolca5w,I sat through the movie to see how the officers were going to connect the dots &amp; identify the real thing but alas that never happened! <br><br><br>Nevertheless a very interesting watch.

oiXdPolca5w,"💯The odds that we will ever see movies of this caliber being produced again in the USA are extremely low. <br><br>With all the political correctness and woke corporations, you’re limited to promoting fat women as leaders over men, transsexuals as normal, and Black people to get leading roles to achieve a quota."
oiXdPolca5w,Kevin Spacey needs to get back into acting.
oiXdPolca5w,"Directed by Brian Singer and starring Kevin Spacey, two of the most noble men in Hollyhood."
oiXdPolca5w,One of the best

oiXdPolca5w,I saw this in the theater when I was in high school. It’s been my favorite movie ever since.
oiXdPolca5w,"Great movie. One of the best.  <br>The narrator sucks, but again, great movie. <br>Sometimes I tell the story of Keyser Soze to people just to see if they&#39;ll catch on that I&#39;m talking about movie. :)"
oiXdPolca5w,I like the climax of this movie. Very impressive. ❤️👌
oiXdPolca5w,Im here bcuase of harlem vs send luks 🔥
oiXdPolca5w,Sino nandito dahil kay Harlem?
oiXdPolca5w,I actually guessed the ending every single thing in this movie was very much predictable for me
oiXdPolca5w,I met Keyser Soze in prison...he also goes by the name of Martin Bryant.

oiXdPolca5w,People who watched it?<br>Should I watch this movie 🎥?؟؟؟
oiXdPolca5w,I absolutely love this movie
oiXdPolca5w,"Em....What even is this movie even about? I haven&#39;t seen this movie, this is the first time I&#39;m seeing this trailer....<br><br>What is this movie? This trailer told me nothing about what this movie is about."
oiXdPolca5w,Same guy from se7en is the main villain. Similar movie too
oiXdPolca5w,"Keyser Söze = George Norcross: Demorat power bowerbress tp destrol lowerlevel acctes tp those attempt to<br>Brother: US Congressman - Donald Norcross<br>Et Al Numerous prominent Camden County democrat officials, Assorted local Union affiliations, Pagans Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs and associates, and local La Cosa Nostra associates. <br>Entire roster available at NSA and DOD. Possibly the largest assemblance of organized crime under the RICO indictment. Bigger than Gotti! Predicition: Will be aborted and obliterated under a pervasive and corrupt Biden administration. But on the street level will completely abushed, arrested, indicted, and charged with numerous indictmemts regarding numorous internationale indictable offensesl I.E. Thoskkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkfffe that a  are La Cosa Nostra will be eventually indicted, but those operaiinting"
oiXdPolca5w,I have a few questions if someone figured it out pls answer. Oh and <b>SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE</b> <br><br>How did that Hungarian guy from the hospital see keysar? And how did he know it was him if only arturro had seen him? And why did keyser/verbal hang around after the explosion so the police could pick him up? And why go to all the trouble of pulling strings to get himself immunity if he was gonna spill to the detective anyway? Why did drop all those clues so the detective could figure out who he was? I guess you could say he was playing mind games and his motive was to spread fear and let the people know he was behind it but then the whole point of his operation was so no one could recognize him (which he failed in seeing that the Hungarian and now the detective know his face).
oiXdPolca5w,โอเค 👌
oiXdPolca5w,Luks like same story as bollywood chochlate movie
oiXdPolca5w,"I remember at the time this was considered one of the greatest must watch films of the 90s along with Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Fargo, Trainspotting, Lock Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels, Fight Club. I remember when I seen the ending for the first time I was like WTF??!!!!!!"
oiXdPolca5w,Chocolate..indian version of movie
oiXdPolca5w,"such a classic got it in my collection vhs, dvd and Blu-ray"
oiXdPolca5w,"this movie was the first &quot;OH SHIT&quot; moment for me, great film."
oiXdPolca5w,It&#39;d be something if Kevin Spacey wrote and directed a sequel to this movie as to what happens with his villain character!
oiXdPolca5w,If you are looking for the subtitles of this movie &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; then I will suggest you check subwhale.<br>I have tried few sites but all they have are ads and some pop-ups.
oiXdPolca5w,When keyser soze is sus😳😳😳

0or7hSz-7gc,Beautiful film
jY56N6irNCk,For me it wasn&#39;t just about revenge once he went to the school of the little daughter all betswere definitely off the SOB had to die
jY56N6irNCk,The police would be bound to question her about where she obtained the gun.
jY56N6irNCk,Hi guys... Full movie please. I love Keifer S. Best known in the Vanishing... Phonebooth.. STAND by me... The lost boat... LAST night... MANY. I love him Keifer congrats on your Hollywood star walk of fame. Much respect... I LOVE YOU FROM RSA
jY56N6irNCk,I liked this movie but still having problems watching it.
jY56N6irNCk,Love keifer in dis role great bad guy 
jY56N6irNCk,Loved loved the ending 
jY56N6irNCk,"Watch &quot;I Spit on your grave&quot; , The story is a bit like this one, But you get more than expected , its all very clearly (This movie too) , But... It&#39;s crude and horrorfying . But still a better movie ;D. 
P.S. : Sorry for my English , Im Dutch, And only 12 Years so...     "
jY56N6irNCk,"Yes, do the math. You can, can&#39;t you?
And why did he? Because she lured him so she could kill him. This was never about her defending herself.
Because this movie is seeing the wolf through the villagers point of view, a monster, as opposed to a person who is mentally ill.

"
jY56N6irNCk,"do the math? how bout the fact that we conversed  for an hour and a bit, with your comments magically rising in likes. almost like you keep coming back.  the story isnt about hunting down anyone, the fact he comes after her at the end should signify that. the werewolf is the evil located in us all, thats why the person who becomes the werewolf generally doesn&#39;t know they are a wolf. kiefer represents something totally different. werewolf movies are about coming together. this movie was not. 
"
jY56N6irNCk,"In 5 years about 170,000 people have watched this video. Do the math.
When I say werewolf stories, I don&#39;t mean stories about werewolves, it&#39;s a metaphor for stories were the moral is people should hunter down and kill the monsters they see.
Yeah, a spiteful assault. "
jY56N6irNCk,"lol ya because in the last hour one person came read your comment and thumbed it up. whatever. werewolf movies arent a sub genre of revenge movies . they belong to a monster horrors, even more specific classical horror, along with the mummy and the swap thing. revenge: the action of inflicting hurt or harm on someone for a wrong suffered at their hands. keep thumbing your own comments up, it makes no difference to the fact that im right."
jY56N6irNCk,"I don&#39;t think people care that much about commenting on this video, that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t read the comments. If you don&#39;t want to believe this is my only account, then don&#39;t, I don&#39;t give a shit.
Revenge is not standing up for yourself (defending), it&#39;s just spiteful assault.
Yes, and a subgenre of that subgenre are what I call werewolf movies. The difference being the moral of the story advocating such an action."
jY56N6irNCk,"lol considering the last comment beside ours was 2 weeks ago.....i dont think people care that much about our conversation, so yes stop thumbing comments up with other accounts. yes she was standing  up for herself and her family. not only did he make her daughter a victim, he made the whole family a victim. she lured him on to her property hardly a lynch mob. you ve never seen taken. there is a sub genre of movies dedicated to avenging the death of a child. Christ. good day. learn movies."
jY56N6irNCk,"Predatory rape and murder, yes.
She wasn&#39;t standing up for herself, she was intent on revenge for her daughter, and to stop this wolf doing it again.
I&#39;ve never seen Taken, but I doubt it&#39;s as simplistic and unsubtle as this movie is.
Yeah... I only have one YouTube account."
jY56N6irNCk,"rape then murder rarely  happens? the moral of the story is to stand up for yourself. its not just about protecting the future generations, the main character needed to get her life back. the werewolf is far far too simplistic. the werewolf doesnt represent evil, it represents fear. another huge difference. if you notice, the towns folk dont seem to intent on getting the wolf as you put it either. by your logic any taken is a were wolf movie too. thumbing up your own comments?? pathetic. "
jY56N6irNCk,"Yes, a very specific real life issue that almost never happens.
The morale of this story is people should hunter down and kill the evil that exists in this world (the wolf), to protect the women and children. Now if that isn&#39;t the old werewolf story, then I don&#39;t know what is."
jY56N6irNCk,"not at all. first of all it addresses real life issues that are still, believe it or not, on going to this day. Sutherland&#39;s character represents for the second time now, the evil that exists in this world, that is seemingly untouchable. the only reason the evil was stopped, was because sally field, the good guy, the audience if you will, stood up and did something. a werewolf story? not even close. "
jY56N6irNCk,Two stars because it&#39;s essentially nothing more than a modern day werewolf story. 
jY56N6irNCk,"excuse me, but if the cast and director are a list, the movie is a list. the movie was very realistic. it had elements of real life. the meetings the feeling of being hopeless, because the justice system is corrupt, who knew? the button pusher, im assuming you mean Sutherland, is the figure head for what we hate and what is destroying our society even to this day. he is the bad that never seems to get his, until the prey fights back. two stars simply because of a personal vendetta? pfff "
jY56N6irNCk,I loved this movie :D Kiefer was very convincing in this role
jY56N6irNCk,"Alguém tem esse filme completo?
"
jY56N6irNCk,Ed Harris is such a girl in this movie! Sally Field is awesome in any movie!
jY56N6irNCk,"download it, takes 3 mins!"
jY56N6irNCk,"It´s me, or kiefer in Eye for an eye seems James Hetfield??"
jY56N6irNCk,"A B movie that somehow won the lottery and got an A-movie cast and director. The  premise was interesting and the characters felt very realistic, but the movie didn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t fairly question it&#39;s premise as much as dictate it. This blatant button-pusher plays upon our most primal emotions as well as the increasing disdain for the criminal justice system, it&#39;s just a terribly crude and bias movie that operates as propaganda for capital punishment and vigilantism. 2 stars."
jY56N6irNCk,I just Want to know where i can find this movie
jY56N6irNCk,yes u work out in mcdonalds 5 days a week :) 
jY56N6irNCk,also im english bet u dont even no the difference between being british and being english lol .u dumb dumb 
jY56N6irNCk,"Esse filme é otimo
"
jY56N6irNCk,by the way dipshit i no ur comment  was not directed at me but reading comments  to see if it was a good film i see ur shit .
jY56N6irNCk,now i no a guy gets killed  the end so as the film goes on and i see some one brake in a house im gona no the dude gets killed .so u are a troll .
jY56N6irNCk,"I love this movie, I have it on DVD. Many people dismiss it as a &quot;man-hating&quot; sappy Lifetime drama. I bed to differ; albeit a bit predictable at times, it is a constant edge-of-your-seat crime thriller. I myself am a criminal justice graduate heading on to pre-law education. This movie both confirmed and motivated my passion for criminal law and bringing offenders to justice in a professional, rigorous, and expedient manner. Excellent film, you won&#39;t be disappointed."
jY56N6irNCk,"At the beginning of the movie when Sally runs into the younger daughter&#39;s bedroom, you can see the camera guy&#39;s reflection in the mirror. Whoopsie."
jY56N6irNCk,"This movie was very messed up, the part with her daughter getting killed was hard to watch."
jY56N6irNCk,forgive me for being sensitive to such a heinous crime. I&#39;ll try and learn to laugh at girls and women being brutally raped. 
jY56N6irNCk,"Watch Mystic River for the flip side to vigilantism. Kingsnake, you are supposed to dislike the rapist, not like his lines."
jY56N6irNCk,&quot;She was a great ffffuck.&quot; favorite line from Kiefer.
jY56N6irNCk,@lkshaw1 i saw that last night too. you probably live in vegas.
jY56N6irNCk,This movie came on late last night
jY56N6irNCk,@Fanofcartoons1994 what the-?
jY56N6irNCk,this movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved it because for one thing it has sally fields in it and she has got to be the most amazing actresses in the world. Just the whole plot of this movie was awesome. I give it 5 stars .:D and 2 thumbs up. :DDDD &lt;3
jY56N6irNCk,Kiefer looks like James Hetfield (Metallica) in this movie.
jY56N6irNCk,"@orlandobabe 

right!!!?? I&#39;m a guy and I was fucking bawling I swear! "
jY56N6irNCk,"I like this movie for several reasons: two being the cast and the story-I like revenge or vigilante storylines, seeing Sally Field play a role like this was incredible, Kiefer S. was very convincing as a sadistic villian...again. When justice fails, then what do you do? I&#39;m not advocating or condoning what Sally did for real life, but in a movie, it&#39;s easier to condone it. I&#39;m hoping the system wouldn&#39;t fail this badly in real life."
jY56N6irNCk,@HermonieG1 He probbaly just headed butted them right back x) &quot;head on. Apply directly to the FOREHEAD!&quot; He must&#39;ve been real scary in the movie.
jY56N6irNCk,I fucking love this movie.
jY56N6irNCk,watching this movie made me cry lol :P
jY56N6irNCk,i coudn&#39;t ever find Kiefer scary. he&#39;s much too hot!
jY56N6irNCk,"Great idea for a movie and a great cast but i thought it was a terrible movie. For a movie that was released in the theater, it sure felt like I was watching Lifetime.  And to those begging for a Youtube upload, please just pay $7.99/mo for Netflix. It&#39;s totally worth it!"
jY56N6irNCk,"@70sMiLA I saw the rape scene and I couldn&#39;t watch it again, believe me it is hard to watch that without your stomach turning."
jY56N6irNCk,such a bad trailer for such a BRILLIANT MOVIE
jY56N6irNCk,kiefer is awesome 
jY56N6irNCk,Man Kiefer was a damn good badass in this movie
jY56N6irNCk,"I noticed a&quot;blooper&quot; or &quot;mistake&quot; in the movie, while I was watching it. For anyone who has seen it, you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about. In the very beginning, when Sally&#39;s Character is doing her makeup, and then Ed&#39;s character messes it up with the shaving foam, as the camera zooms in, you can see it in the makeup mirror.
Just thought I&#39;d share it!
Great film, a must see!"
jY56N6irNCk,WHO KNOWS WHAT THE SONG IS CALLED WHEN KIEFER IS WATCHING TV AND IS DRUMMING ON HIS LEGS??? HELP!! 
jY56N6irNCk,Kiefer is awesome! Some parts of this are hard to watch to be honest but Kiefer just knocked the whole psycho rapist role out of the park
jY56N6irNCk,"The whole cast was amazing in this movie, but Kiefer turned in one of his best pre-24 performances. "
jY56N6irNCk,"@70sMiLA, &quot;Why hasn&#39;t anyone uploaded this whole movie on youtube yet&quot;?? I&#39;ve only been able to watch it once since it first came on because the scene with Kiefer Sutherland and Olivia Burnette is so horrific and much too graphic for me. The critics and viewers had a field day, saying the exact same thing, don&#39;t know how in the world Olivia pulled that scene off. Everytime I think of it it really deeply saddens me, and fills me with anger even I can&#39;t imagine."
jY56N6irNCk,awesome film i love watching it
jY56N6irNCk,"That rape murder scene still haunts me. 
"
jY56N6irNCk,It&#39;s similar to Enough.
jY56N6irNCk,@Sicksoullleee haha i saw this movie for the first time today and that was exactly what i was thinking!
jY56N6irNCk,Wait why is it R
jY56N6irNCk,when i sow the trailer on tv for 1 sec i thought kiefer was james hetfield and i was about wtf?!?! :P
jY56N6irNCk,@15katevvet yea i know how that is
jY56N6irNCk,"I saw the whole movie on youtube but that person took it off, who knows .. But I saw it for the first time on Lifetime , I&#39;m warning ya .. that first scene is quite disturbing .. had an impact on me .. just creepy how you could be planning a party and the next your dead .. it was a good movie overall .. Sally Field was excellent .. Keifer was soo creepy , great job .  But it was a little hard to watch that scene , not gunna lie"
jY56N6irNCk,this was an awesome movie. I was about the same age as the girl in the movie ( the victim) and the rape scene was graphically real even I was scared to be home alone for a while after that movie :(
jY56N6irNCk,"If this was a Dirty Harry movie, you could bet that Kiefer&#39;s character would have had his creepy ass blown away by Clint..."
jY56N6irNCk,"Have only been able to watch this movie once, as the rape scenes are much too realistic and horrifying to watch (at least they were for me)."
jY56N6irNCk,"@SparksDrinker .....(o_o)....um no, I lack a certain thing in order to do that."
jY56N6irNCk,When Julie answers the door that&#39;s not in the movie. Did they just do that for the trailer to disguise what was to follow in the actual film? The brutal rape.
jY56N6irNCk,i fill bad for that  17 year old she die she got killed buy a grown man she iz so so so scared when he was triyin to put it i9nbut i can tell thasz fake because cusz it showed her pantansz when he pulled her up to hisz dick that was so so so so fucken gross
jY56N6irNCk,"@70sMiLA Because that would be illegal, spend a couple bucks like a normal person if you want to see it."
jY56N6irNCk,"Rapists and killers deserve no compassion, in my opinion. As for the revenge storyline, I like the genre, no matter how cliched it may get.  
The movie is very well done, the cast, esp.
I&#39;m not an advocate for taking the law in your own hands, but if justice fails, then what do you do? I can&#39;t condone failure of justice anymore than murder or rape. Plus I refuse to condemn what Sally Field does in the end, because justice did fail miserably, her and her daughter and I hope real justice works."
jY56N6irNCk,"Next time you watch it, look in the little sister&#39;s dresser mirror when Sally Field runs into her bedroom (first minute of the movie). You can see the cameraperson in it. Kinda wrecked it for me for awhile. But it was a good movie. The attack scenes were hard to watch though."
jY56N6irNCk,This movie is ok but really inaccurate.  After the second woman he killed there wouldn&#39;t be any doubt as to his guilt in real life.
jY56N6irNCk,"Next time you watch it, keep your eye on the mirror in the little girl&#39;s bedroom when Sally Field runs in there (opening minute of the film). You can see a crew member in a red shirt. Whoops!"
jY56N6irNCk,Such a great movie!!
jY56N6irNCk,it&#39;s Shining road by Cranes :)
jY56N6irNCk,im looking for the song 2  :(
jY56N6irNCk,"oh please, can someone upload this movie?
i never had the chance to watch it, but i heard it&#39;s great:)"
jY56N6irNCk,Kiefer always had that fuckin&#39; great voice?! Damn. Even when he was like 20.
jY56N6irNCk,"just to let browneyednessagirl93 u can get this dvd in WH SMITH, for around £12"
jY56N6irNCk,"When Sutherland&#39;s character says &quot;Ssssorry&quot; a long Sorry was he like making fun of her daughter because at the beginning she did stutter a bit, and Sutherland never did it after that.

Also Sally Field did seem to get over her daughter&#39;s death a little quick I think it would have been a little better it they would have skipped ahead 2 months maybe."
jY56N6irNCk,"Truly one of the best movies that Kiefer Sutherland ever did.

Kiefer rocks!!!"
jY56N6irNCk,Any1 know where to find this movie??? I can&#39;t find it newhere!
jY56N6irNCk,kief  is good plaing bad is so sexy he is a excelent actor*****
jY56N6irNCk,dude I just watched that movie and I fu***** hate that guy so much. I fealt so sorry for that girl in the beggining of the movie :(
jY56N6irNCk,"seriously - it shows what an amazing actor he is, he&#39;s sooo creepily believable!"

MubmJ2jwvOM,"Or, they could just unplug him"
MubmJ2jwvOM,I forgot how bad this was. 😩 maybe 1 time to watch not 2.
MubmJ2jwvOM,This is what happens when you spend to much time in vr chat
MubmJ2jwvOM,"I would love to tell you The Truth from The Holy Bible about what is going on. However, I politely encourage you to read it for yourselves. By The Way, check out Truthunedited and Stephan Darby&#39;s sermons to get a deeper understanding for The Life. May Yah bless you and HALLELUYAH!"
MubmJ2jwvOM,"Man, the propaganda is thick in this. If you know what to look for, its literally all over it.<br>Its shown numerous times in the trailer. Even their symbol."
MubmJ2jwvOM,"That kid with the beret is totally awesome, dude."
MubmJ2jwvOM,666 was on the banner in Hebrew when he says I am the savior.
MubmJ2jwvOM,"Shame on you Ted Turner, shame on you New Line and shame on you Farhad Mann!"
MubmJ2jwvOM,What&#39;s the name of the choir for this trailer?
MubmJ2jwvOM,The awfulness of this trailer is what has made it timeless and worth watching 30 years later. I’m pretty sure I only know this film from the trailer being on a VHS copy of Mortal Kombat I think.
MubmJ2jwvOM,If they made a part 3 today imagine the cgi it make millions

MubmJ2jwvOM,"Man, Max Headroom really let himself go in the 90&#39;s... quite sad seeing how he turned out really :("
MubmJ2jwvOM,This trailer is better then the movie
MubmJ2jwvOM,Max Headroom vs The World
MubmJ2jwvOM,interesting how parts of the movie actually looked like Max Headroom which Frewer was also in
MubmJ2jwvOM,This was the first movie where I was consciously aware of the 90&#39;s dark future meme awkwardly shoved into a random film.
MubmJ2jwvOM,TODOS LOS SHAPESHIFTING ACTORES SATANICOS SYCOPATAS SE ACEN PASAR POR FALSOS ANGELES Y DIOSES PERO LA REAL VERDA ES QUE SE ALIMENTAN DE EL DOLOR Y SUFRIMIENTO DE LA HUMANIDA PERSONAS GENTE Y ANIMALES INOMINE PATRIS ET FILII ET SPIRITUS SANCTI AMEN AMEN AMEN!!!!...
MubmJ2jwvOM,Calling this the continuation from the 1st movie is just terrible.
MubmJ2jwvOM,This guy played the father in honey I shrunk the kids . Couldn’t take him seriously as a villain . Up all night watching fh try 90s movie trailers is awesome

MubmJ2jwvOM,Pew pew pew!!
MubmJ2jwvOM,The CGI didn&#39;t even hold up at the time of this movie&#39;s release.
MubmJ2jwvOM,Cyberpunk 1995...
MubmJ2jwvOM,i read this movie is so bad that you want to see it
MubmJ2jwvOM,I remember seeing this trailer on my VHS tape of Mortal Kombat. Otherwise I would never have even heard of this movie.
MubmJ2jwvOM,Trashcan Man got an upgrade.
MubmJ2jwvOM,"So, in other words...Mad Max Headroom?!"
MubmJ2jwvOM,Disney’s Tron...the horror version
MubmJ2jwvOM,In here... I Am the savior.
MubmJ2jwvOM,Apparently someone won a walk-on role in this piece of shit.

YC3npzqwXcs,Szex4spra
YC3npzqwXcs,"If i remember correctly <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23salmahayek"">#SalmaHayek</a> also has a small role in the movie. Good olden days"
YC3npzqwXcs,Baldwin best movie ever
YC3npzqwXcs,Magnífica película de acción
YC3npzqwXcs,Good for a drunk watch
YC3npzqwXcs,This movie looks like fun! I really want to watch it now!
YC3npzqwXcs,"Fun Fact: This film was based off of the novel of the same name, which 10 years earlier had been adapted into the Sylvester Stallone action movie &quot;Cobra.&quot; Another criminally (no pun intended) underrated gem of the 80s."
YC3npzqwXcs,I went to see this movie with my parents I think and when that sex scene came up it was very uncomfortable! haha it happened again when we went to see showgirls xD
YC3npzqwXcs,its a really good movie actually
YC3npzqwXcs,I can&#39;t stand how cheesy the voice-over guy is! Ugh!
YC3npzqwXcs,"Fair Game (1995)<br>⤵⤵<br><a href=""http://viro.netizenn.one/"">viro.netizenn.one</a><br><br>los  mortales abian apreciado tan hermosa mujer  .<br><br>Tu..belleza.viaja.al.universo.se.reune.con.estrellas.<br>y.luceros...tu.mirada.enamora.al.sol.....tu.hermosura.quedara.por..una.eternidad. en .los.corazonede.<br>tus.admiradores......feliz<br>Navidad.y.noche.buena....mis. respeto .para.todas.las.mujes.del.mundo...saludos..al.fin.del.mundoos  mortales abian apreciado tan hermosa mujer  .<br><br><br>Asi con toy y sus maNÍ as no se la <br>hay nomas pa ra reirse un rato y no estar triste y estresado por la vida dura que se vive hoy... ðŸ–¤<br>y.luceros...tu.mirada.enamora.al.sol.....tu.hermosura.quedara.por..una.eternidad.en.los.corazonede"
YC3npzqwXcs,Is it just me or has any other bi-sexual masturbated during the whole movie fantasizing about Baldwin and Crawford?
YC3npzqwXcs,Cindy 😍
YC3npzqwXcs,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC3npzqwXcs&amp;t=1m40s"">1:40</a> this shot is literally making of footage, that&#39;s a huge mat at the bottom (in the film they jump in the sea)"
YC3npzqwXcs,Cobra reboot
YC3npzqwXcs,My guess off 1000s of these turkeys... Chris McDonald is the weasle lol Cindy lost her Razzie to It&#39;s Pat actress Sweeny. It&#39;s supposed to be a true representation of the novel... the same one Stallone paid to skim for Cobra.
YC3npzqwXcs,Being a lawyer in the 90s was as desirable as being in tech today..
YC3npzqwXcs,I wonder?... Is there terrible acting? Five too many unnecessary action scenes? Do they live? Do they figure out who the killer is? Do they fall in love? I’m guessing yes to everything.
YC3npzqwXcs,"Underrated movie, decent action, eye candy for both sexes, what more could you ask for from this type of movie?"
YC3npzqwXcs,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC3npzqwXcs&amp;t=1m17s"">1:17</a> You see that hot chick? She was a badass in Aliens."
YC3npzqwXcs,A Silver Pictures
YC3npzqwXcs,Stupid but good.
YC3npzqwXcs,The movie was much more than just a gorgeous face. Her acting was surprisingly ok. The move is quite underrated. I give the movie a well-deserved 6.4 out of 10. Which is not bad considering most movies today I barely give a 3 out of 10 🤣🤣🤣🤣🎥
YC3npzqwXcs,One of the actors I can&#39;t get enough of.
YC3npzqwXcs,I love this!!🤷‍♀️
YC3npzqwXcs,"Loved watching it....again, I think"
YC3npzqwXcs,The best trailer voiceover guy! I mimic his voice at least once a week
YC3npzqwXcs,she couldn’t even act well in the trailer
YC3npzqwXcs,Cindy is beautiful
YC3npzqwXcs,thanks for the reminder bonfire. crackle crackle
YC3npzqwXcs,I gotta say - this doesn’t look that bad! I might have to hunt for a DVD. 😁
YC3npzqwXcs,Cindy Crawford 😍
YC3npzqwXcs,He looks like nathan drake of uncharted
YC3npzqwXcs,Kate (Crawford) was singled out between the good guys and bad guys and handed a tough part. I bought the DVD and play it from time to time. What&#39;s so weird is this trailer. Many of the scenes shown here never made it to the real film.
YC3npzqwXcs,"these 90s movies may are crap, but i prefer them much more than the crap from nowadays...what happened to Holllywood?? anyone can explain?"
YC3npzqwXcs,pow powwww powwwwwwwww
YC3npzqwXcs,underrated movie weigh higher than 13% on rotten tomatoes
YC3npzqwXcs,Weird that this movie and &quot;Cobra&quot; 1986 - are based off the same book...<br><br>One movie is delightful 80s shit.<br><br>The other movie is delightful 90s shit.
YC3npzqwXcs,film penuh kenangan
YC3npzqwXcs,"lol the guy dumps Salma Hayek on her early 20&#39;s to stay with Cindy, what an idiot"
YC3npzqwXcs,i miss these 90&#39;s movies - crap but good.
YC3npzqwXcs,people Is it like knife?
YC3npzqwXcs,&quot;Now if they can only stand each other!&quot; <br><br>This is a 90&#39;s movie all the way. <br><br>I &lt;3 Cindy&#39;s boobs.
YC3npzqwXcs,classic bond film Cyndy is Raquel Welch n she n WLM work well tghtr.
YC3npzqwXcs,This movie is cool

hck5I4F1OgU,"Ay cabron sentí una vibra en todo mi cuerpo.que chingón.maravilloso magestuoso.1995 es mi año de secundaria. ,,mis años mis recuerdos aún recuerdo el tráiler de esta película.chido"
hck5I4F1OgU,I haven’t been able to find this movie on a DVD that plays in the U.S. <br>thank you so much for this trailer. I remember seeing it back in 1995 and loved it. <br>I’m still searching for a way to see it.
GJ6-ymSjShg,불안정애착인 여자와 안정애착이<br>만나 진정한 사랑이 이뤄졌네요.<br>이 영화처럼 실제로 현실방영을 한다면  96년이 30대라면 58살쯤 되겠네요 .  아이들도 컸을 것이고  잘살고 있겠죠.
GJ6-ymSjShg,I love this movie so much.  i have this movie on VHS and DVD.
GJ6-ymSjShg,Why can&#39;t this be watched on any streaming service
GJ6-ymSjShg,Título y quien canta la canción del principio del trailer?
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Fantastic trailer, absolute abomination of a film <br>Riddled with tired cliches, poor acting and terrible directing of a badly written script.<br>Its a wonder it didn’t completely derail Slaters career!"
GJ6-ymSjShg,what is this bulshit?
GJ6-ymSjShg,Why why cant I watch it anywhere in the UK I saw the film has young girl fell in love with the film even to the point I became a florist someone please help
GJ6-ymSjShg,"God!! I remember when this trailer and movie came out!  I wanted to take a girl to it so bad, but I couldn&#39;t find one that was romantic!  I really miss the 90&#39;s!  If I could redo it?!??!"
GJ6-ymSjShg,The quickest way to get a restraining order!
GJ6-ymSjShg,Amo esta película pero no puedo encontrarla completa 😭 como puedo hacer?
GJ6-ymSjShg,"This is such an outstanding timeless movie here, I think this came out in 1996 but I&#39;m not too sure. Anyway I think they need to do a anniversary of the movie and do behind the scenes and interviews with the Stars too. Just saying it would be a good idea."
GJ6-ymSjShg,Yes sign me up
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Id like to see this movie <a href=""http://again.is/"">again.is</a> it possible?"
GJ6-ymSjShg,This is one of my all time favorites! I love this movie💜💙
GJ6-ymSjShg,"This is such an underrated romantic film.  I never hear it being mentioned when people talk about the romances from the 90s.  I remember seeing a trailer for it when I was a teen and finally watched it on cable tv a couple years later.  It was a lovely film and now that I own it, I&#39;ll definitely watch it more often.  It&#39;s a shame they don&#39;t make movies like this anymore.<br><br>Also, who would love to have a great friend like Kim in their life?  She&#39;s very encouraging &amp; supportive and truly cares about Lisa enough to tell her when she&#39;s being ridiculous. lol"
GJ6-ymSjShg,Anyone knows exactly where did the shooting of this flim take place ?
GJ6-ymSjShg,I love this movie.
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Bed of roses, Some kind of Wonderful, True romance Heathers and thing with Christian Slater.👍"
GJ6-ymSjShg,My mom took me to see this when I was 12. I only remember the song. Definitely need to revisit this movie.
GJ6-ymSjShg,I really liked this movie as a 90s tween. I thought it was really romantic in my innocent brain. I showed it to my family and they all made fun of it. Hurt my feelings a lot lol
GJ6-ymSjShg,Seems like a corny movie but I do love 80s and 90s movies where they incorporate so much of NYC into it.
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Love you forever, Christian. And I hope to God I can one day put a camera on you and let you do your craft while playing the lead in a movie i wrote and directed!!!!!!!"
GJ6-ymSjShg,Can someone upload it please
GJ6-ymSjShg,I would give up everything to relive the 90&#39;s
GJ6-ymSjShg,Times were so much better in the late 90&#39;s
GJ6-ymSjShg,I.liked this movie
GJ6-ymSjShg,Yes he would be considered a creep now and days
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Twelve years and no one has said it? Alright, I’ll leave the comment.<br><br><br>Dammit Bobby!"
GJ6-ymSjShg,What’s the first music call?
GJ6-ymSjShg,I remember they showed this trailer in front of Jumanji (1995) on theatres. I was 6 years old at the time! Mannn I miss the 90s!!
GJ6-ymSjShg,Before independent love song
GJ6-ymSjShg,Please tell me what music is this?
GJ6-ymSjShg,But wait- isn&#39;t J.D. dead?
GJ6-ymSjShg,One of my all time favs :)
GJ6-ymSjShg,La vi en el cine pero no la puedo conseguir quiero verla otra vez
GJ6-ymSjShg,What&#39;s the name of the song towards the end?
GJ6-ymSjShg,"To this day, Christian Slater is one of my acting idols. I used to dress like his character from True Romance when i was in my teens!"
GJ6-ymSjShg,One romantic movie i cried for first time watching i was 15 and the movie was shown on tv in my country in 2004. The ending part just.... so touching
GJ6-ymSjShg,I love this movie I wish it was available to buy digitally on one of the streaming sites.
GJ6-ymSjShg,You can’t watch this online anywhere!!! It’s one of my favs!
GJ6-ymSjShg,"You need this awesome movie!!!!!!!!   <a href=""https://www.ebay.com/itm/224198229614"">https://www.ebay.com/itm/224198229614</a>"
GJ6-ymSjShg,Love this aesthetic ♡
GJ6-ymSjShg,my mom was supposed to be in this movie when she was an actress but she didn’t want to be in it. 😂😕
GJ6-ymSjShg,It was a good movie.
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Cincinnati, Chelsea, Columbus Crew"
GJ6-ymSjShg,The music in this trailer 😩😍
GJ6-ymSjShg,Where I can watch this movie? Or a link.<br>Thank you!
GJ6-ymSjShg,This is the most 90&#39;s trailer I&#39;ve ever seen
GJ6-ymSjShg,This is such underrated romantic movie
GJ6-ymSjShg,He&#39;s gorgeous. Loved him in untamed hearts
GJ6-ymSjShg,"I love this movie, saw it in theaters by myself and became romanced by the whole thing. It was one lonely person connecting to another lonely person. They don&#39;t make romantic films like these anymore."
GJ6-ymSjShg,"This movie pissed me off. Trailer too. Lots of deleted scenes show up in the trailer ugh. <br>MSM character was cold, manipulating and boring."
GJ6-ymSjShg,This and only you. Best rom coms ever
GJ6-ymSjShg,The best movie! Beautiful love story ever!🌹🌹🌹😍 I need somebody like Louis...
GJ6-ymSjShg,Beautiful
GJ6-ymSjShg,I was a very Handsome Bastard wasn&#39;t I???
GJ6-ymSjShg,Dear friends<br>This song is called &quot;independent love Song&quot; -Scarlet.
GJ6-ymSjShg,I remember this trailer on television when it first aired in theaters.. 😂😂😂 it was a good movie....I had a crush on Mary Stuart Masterson....👍
GJ6-ymSjShg,Ugh why don&#39;t guys like this exist?!!
GJ6-ymSjShg,Fantastic movie!
GJ6-ymSjShg,Simply my favorite love movie of all times. Death against love. Time against reason. One sensitive man. One good girl. This film is at least for both men and women&#39;s. I like nothing about so called romantic films of today. They all suck.
GJ6-ymSjShg,Nice movie
GJ6-ymSjShg,"I haven&#39;t seen this movie in years, I&#39;ve always loved it. But wow....that is my life right now."
GJ6-ymSjShg,this move make me cry
GJ6-ymSjShg,My favorite movie in the 90s.  I still have the VHS. 🙈
GJ6-ymSjShg,I was in the Marines and I CRY every time I watch the end of this film ...  <b>DAMMIT</b> !!!
GJ6-ymSjShg,"I like this movie, but yes this trailer pretty much is the sum of the film...."
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Two likable stars in only a fair movie.  Really, if you watch the trailer here, you&#39;ve SEEN the movie. The actors are the best things in it."
GJ6-ymSjShg,This movie ranks as the Best Love Story ever!
GJ6-ymSjShg,I would die to see it again. Any help? I love it!!!
GJ6-ymSjShg,Best Movie in the World Bar None It is my favorite
GJ6-ymSjShg,I watch this movie two or three times a year. It&#39;s one of my &quot;late night&quot; movies when I wake up and can&#39;t get back to sleep. I can practically recite this movie. Is that bad? I would never tell anyone that out loud.
GJ6-ymSjShg,A TRULY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE THAT BRINGS JOY AND HOPE TO US ALL .
GJ6-ymSjShg,Love this instrumental version of the song. Wish I could get this version
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Oh wow! I remember this movie. Just finished watching parts of (couldn&#39;t make it all the way through) Slater&#39;s Playback, and I wanted to come and cleanse my mental palate with something from when he was a charming screen idol."
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Thank you!  I would never thought about sharing this movie with someone.<br>This is really pretty script, I think. Not much PC. Good time for Hollywood."
GJ6-ymSjShg,i fell in love with Mary Stewart Masterson because of this movie
GJ6-ymSjShg,Almost 20 years ago... omg!!! A beautiful movie with an unforgettable soundtrack.
GJ6-ymSjShg,never seen this yet i feel as though its the 100th time ive seen it
GJ6-ymSjShg,La película más romántica basada en un caso real 
GJ6-ymSjShg,A underrated movie
GJ6-ymSjShg,Amanda - it&#39;s Independent Love Song by Scarlet
GJ6-ymSjShg,Totally love this movie...and the soundtrack was a perfect fit.
GJ6-ymSjShg,"find full movie here <a href=""http://viooz.co/movies/7249-bed-of-roses-1996.html"">http://viooz.co/movies/7249-bed-of-roses-1996.html</a>"
GJ6-ymSjShg,where can I find this full movie that actually works?? I wanna see it!! :D
GJ6-ymSjShg,one of the most romanticmovies ever!!! i LOVE this movie
GJ6-ymSjShg,not if it&#39;s Slater :P 
GJ6-ymSjShg,Because this is a movie and unrealistic.
GJ6-ymSjShg,what&#39;s the name of the song in this trailer?
GJ6-ymSjShg,"It actually would. Stalkerish and Sweet are determined by how the guy actually looks most of the time, unfortunately. Since it&#39;s Slater.. well... it looks sweet."
GJ6-ymSjShg,christian slater was sucha hot 90&#39;s hunk
GJ6-ymSjShg,no. personally i think thats really romantic. it would be stalkeresque if he watched her every night for a month and then sent her flowers along with a letter about what their future grandchildren would be named lol. or if he saw her somewhere else and followed her home. but just happening to see her through he window when he was out walking for his own purposes and sending her flowers because she was sad is really sweet and thoughtful. &lt;3
GJ6-ymSjShg,"I disagree. Now, breaking into her house would be considered &quot;creepy&quot; and &quot;stalking.&quot;"
GJ6-ymSjShg,hey this trailer was shown in the Now and Then vhs previews when i saw this as a little kid!
GJ6-ymSjShg,just a woman wh owatch too much stephen king movies!normal woman would like that!
GJ6-ymSjShg,"i think too many women hide their own insecurities behind &quot;stalker&quot; tags on guys who are genuinely interested and like the old fashioned way of try try again..  its become commonplace to throw away what you have for what you ASSUME is better, only to find out its worse and more full of crap than the first 90-100."
GJ6-ymSjShg,"Yes if the guy was ugly and broke, what about Tom Cruize or Will Smith watching your window?LOL"
GJ6-ymSjShg,This movie is YT for free in full. 
GJ6-ymSjShg,"You&#39;d need a mop to clean up the amount of sap that oozes from their trailer, and that&#39;s only a section of the film. "
GJ6-ymSjShg,In real life yes--but if she did&#39;nt fall in love with him in this case there would be no storyline! LOL

kDdwRURSEzI,Great movie.  A movie watchers movie if that makes sense...
kDdwRURSEzI,"Sean Penn is a genius, I didn&#39;t know he wrote the story."
kDdwRURSEzI,Please add &quot;Written and directed by Sean Penn&quot; to the description
kDdwRURSEzI,"Man, what a great film. That final scene at the graveyard."
kDdwRURSEzI,Anjelica Huston is the greatest 🤍
kDdwRURSEzI,he turned into the person he hates and now he works at the local school ... as a crossing guard.
kDdwRURSEzI,Jack Nicholson is awesome... I liked this movie !!!
kDdwRURSEzI,Such a great performance by Jack

Awng-jZnkoY,Watching!!😍😍😍
Awng-jZnkoY,Omg  reading his book now
Awng-jZnkoY,"Much more entertaining than many professional critics suggest. Each viewer, including every critic, has his own tastes and expectations. But this flick is just as plausible as most movies of the contemporary genre. And infinitely more exciting. <br><br>Many reviews seem to be written to ride on puns, word twists, and other cutesy literary angles. I suspect that many critics enjoyed this movie more than their pseudo-creative evaluations indicate."
Awng-jZnkoY,It is the great regret of my life that I never got to make love with Demi Moore
Awng-jZnkoY,"I loved! <br><br>Only ignored at the Oscars (at least for nominations): Adapted screenplay, considering that it was built on a book and best supporting actor (Alec Baldwin).<br><br>At the time of its release it was heavily criticized by &quot;experts&quot; in cinema.<br><br>But if we listen to these people, we will stop watching great productions"
Awng-jZnkoY,Magnífica película
Awng-jZnkoY,This is one of those unloved gems.theyre out there...ignore the reviews...the reviews say marvel drivel is good.
Awng-jZnkoY,"Judging by the setting, it looks like she&#39;s a rural juror"

Awng-jZnkoY,Is this movie title they mocked in 30 Rock?
Awng-jZnkoY,Optimus Prime!
Awng-jZnkoY,Ahhhhh...baby jgl!!!
Awng-jZnkoY,"Kim was 40 when they married, he didn&#39;t have her in her prime."
Awng-jZnkoY,Gah. I wish my boyfriend would do that. Its one of my favorite lines in movie history.
Awng-jZnkoY,I only watched this trailer for Joseph Gordon-Levitt :P lol 
Awng-jZnkoY,Omg Lil Joseph Gordon-Levitt!! MyHeart &lt;3 &lt;3
Awng-jZnkoY,"If you yelled it as loud as he did, I can see why she got mad...."
Awng-jZnkoY,i love demis voice
Awng-jZnkoY,"Just a little advice for the guys. I was driving to Asheville, NC with my girlfriend when this movie popped up in my head. As she enjoyed the mountains and scenery, I spontaneously shouted, &quot;WHO WILL PROTECT YOU?!&quot; Needless to say, my g/f was not amused. So don&#39;t do this during a roadtrip with the wife or girlfriend. It&#39;s not a battle worth fighting. lol"
Awng-jZnkoY,Parte de esta peli de filmo en Guatemala. En T&#39;ui Cuch
Awng-jZnkoY,&quot;TAKE HOLLYWOOD HOME!!!&quot; Gotta love that jingle!

Awng-jZnkoY,OMG Joseph &lt;33
Awng-jZnkoY,"I remember watching this film with my Mum almost 4 years ago when I was 14,and I thought it was pretty good! This is the film that started my crush on Joseph Gordon-Levitt :&#39;D x"
Awng-jZnkoY,OMG the juror! The Rural Juror!!!! 30 Rock! alec baldwin in both!?! anybody else see this here?????
Awng-jZnkoY,I was suppose to read the book of what this movie was based on for a book report due next week and I haven&#39;t read any of it D:
Awng-jZnkoY,"@MrMAZZINGO 
For the movie or the trailer.  The Trailer music is John Williams&#39;s Presumed Innocent."
Awng-jZnkoY,little Joseph Gordon-Levitt is so cute &lt;3
Awng-jZnkoY,I loved the voice overs that 90&#39;s movies had. :) 
Awng-jZnkoY,"In conclusion, this doesn&#39;t try to be &#39;smart.&#39;"
Awng-jZnkoY,"Plus, Demi asks her onscreen son why he cut something out of the papers and he says that she told him to, and she says he &#39;never&#39; helps her, which helps you like Terminator 2 &#39;more.&#39; This is the worst Demi film of 1996."
Awng-jZnkoY,"@perfection0x The way Demi treated him by calling him a cry-baby, I wanted to smack her HARD in the face."
Awng-jZnkoY,"this movie  make me so mad, i can not even express the emotion."
Awng-jZnkoY,"Joseph Gordon Levitt looks soo cute!!!
looks like an amazing movie

Awng-jZnkoY,good movie!! i saw it last night on starz
Awng-jZnkoY,"how old is Joseph Gordon-Levitt here? 
;)"
Awng-jZnkoY,"Yes, Alec Baldwin was very beautiful and sexy actor. Demi Moore was awesome. The Juror was great scary thriller"
Awng-jZnkoY,".. a disturbing look at criminal intervention in our legal system,weak plot and poorly acted but baldwin manages to hold it together."
i1o_PO3ridY,Great Movie..💪 one of my Favorite&#39;s !!
i1o_PO3ridY,"classic lines in this movie. Buckwheats! and everyone I show this movie to, loves it."
i1o_PO3ridY,Great film!
i1o_PO3ridY,"I think it may be a underated movie, this is a really good one, for those who understand it. <br>It&#39;s originale, and at the same time it got everything. Every good little detail that most other movies lack.<br>And first class acting. This chemistry between Walken and Garcia is very interesting, memorable."
i1o_PO3ridY,Nunn?! Forsyte?! What about Steve Buscemi?
i1o_PO3ridY,BOAT DRINKS PEOPLE.
i1o_PO3ridY,i am what im!!!
i1o_PO3ridY,aahh yes.......90&#39;s movie trailers with that deep voiced dialogue:) I miss this era of film. The trailers were kind of corny but the movies were really cool. today it&#39;s kind of the opposite as the trailers are epic but most films are disappointing.
i1o_PO3ridY,@painey86 Absolutely right voice over man sounds like a prick
i1o_PO3ridY,FECAL FREAK
i1o_PO3ridY,what a hideous trailer for a phenomenal film
i1o_PO3ridY,"there&#39;s no shiny briefcase McGuffin in this script, like in Pulp Fiction. Truth be told, Scott Rosenberg is a writer to be reckoned with (or at least was) -- Things to Do in Denver, Beautiful Girls, Con Air, High Fidelity, Gone in 60 Seconds, Armageddon . . . Of Rosenberg&#39;s bad films, you have Impostor and (the wonderful) Highway. "
i1o_PO3ridY,"Perfect movie, just freaking perfect! Violent, funny, romantic, moral without being preachy, it&#39;s flawless. Scotty Rosenberg, you knocked it outta the park!"
i1o_PO3ridY,BAD ASS MOVIE
i1o_PO3ridY,The whole fucking movie in a 1 min 55 second trailer.
i1o_PO3ridY,"damn this one&#39;s bringing out the worst in our comments.  great film, one i&#39;ll see again and again."
i1o_PO3ridY,@nuclearjew  and anybody gives a fuck about your opinion your name is nuclear jew
i1o_PO3ridY,@nuclearjew go to hell!!! all hail Jimmy the Saint!!!
i1o_PO3ridY,"@nuclearjew Saw this in a theater after your Back Street Boys concert in &#39;94, making you about 15?
Not mad at you, dickweed, just have little tolerance for those with no clue as to the derivation of words/terms in their own vernacular.
&quot;Boat drinks&quot;, cool! &quot;Buckwheats&quot; cool! &quot;Dickweed&quot;, enlightened.....ahhhh......"
i1o_PO3ridY,"@scottythesaint  Everyone was so caught up in the hysteria about Pulp Fiction (a great movie), &amp; this one was wrongfully compared to that... &amp; died a very sad death, to live forever in the shadow... It&#39;s a classic. Walken, Loyd, Garcia, Williams, Forsythe, Buscheme, Cobb, etc., jesus........."
i1o_PO3ridY,"Agred, it&#39;s entertaining and these kids today will believe anything."
i1o_PO3ridY,come on dude. I saw that you uploaded 3 or 4 scenes from the movie. You can&#39;t be serious... This is a kick ass movie. Pulp Fiction is a great movie too. We mustn&#39;t compare these 2 movies. Totally different stories. I can&#39;t find any similarities between these 2
i1o_PO3ridY,brooklyn jimmie flatbush ave best pizza and best buckwheats
i1o_PO3ridY,Mr. shoosh is coming 2 give u big hot buckwheats
i1o_PO3ridY,"pulp fiction is an amazing movie, but it has nothing to do with this one... this is one o my fav movies, its full of memorable scenes and the dialogue is unforgettable"
i1o_PO3ridY,"That ad in no way does justice to the film, it made it look atrocious."
i1o_PO3ridY,I mean not directly opposed to your judgement of Pulp Fiction being a good movie.
i1o_PO3ridY,"I didn&#39;t mean to be insulting with the &quot;f***n****f***&quot;. That was uncool. Just wanted to make a point.
Else I think I&#39;m correct, but not directly opposed to your judgement. Sorry for the wording."
i1o_PO3ridY,"Why do you compare two completely different things?
This one&#39;s nothing like Pulp Fiction. This here stuff&#39;s about morals, and values, and integrity.
Pulp Fiction is about incredible visuals and &quot;fuck-nigga-fuck-what-a-strange-and-wonderful-world&quot; kinda stuff."
i1o_PO3ridY,Any one get the ending Ive seen it about five times me and my mates just argue ...there not dead are they it was just a guy telling a story and they got of with the money ?
i1o_PO3ridY,AHAHAH they used cues from Black Rain for this trailer.
i1o_PO3ridY,One of the most underrated films EVER!
qiAyu1qKkfE,"I rarely comment. This preview does no justice to this amazing film. If it looked boring, please do yourself a favor and trust that everyone who reviewed it loved this film. It is an underrecognized masterpiece."

And her doing that cougar/cat exercise outside with that guy coming onto her was stupid. The old lady was a bore. What a pretentious family spending time together during a pretentious summer in the pretentious Hamptons.  Leave pretentious films to the pretentious king - WOODY ALLEN.  No one even comes close."
FmYKCjilWAs,this movie is kickass.

BRgCb1QjOv4,i didn&#39;t actually get it why they call it black sheep
BRgCb1QjOv4,Chris Farley was one of my favorite comedians having seen all his movies from Coneheads to Almost Heroes. His performance as lovable goofball Mike Donnelly was hilarious and the jokes were on target. Pairing him up with David Spade again made the film enjoyable
BRgCb1QjOv4,you can thank will ferrel for that
BRgCb1QjOv4,i hate how siskel and elbert rated this movie as a horrible movie i thought it was awesome
BRgCb1QjOv4,comedys not the same anymore :p
BRgCb1QjOv4,I love this movie. I hate how people have to compare this to Tommy Boy. Tommy Boy&#39;s a great movie. This is still a good movie in it&#39;s own right. Not every movie is going to be &quot;Tommy Boy.&quot; 
BRgCb1QjOv4,@lanegwyn It&#39;s a completely different movie then Tommy Boy. It&#39;s not a low Standard. 
BRgCb1QjOv4,"&quot;Kill whitey!&quot; That scene is hilarious. This move, along with &quot;Tommy Boy,&quot; are in my top five favorite comedies of all time."
BRgCb1QjOv4,Rip Chris Farley he was so energysed!!! 
BRgCb1QjOv4,this movie should be bigger then avatar and batman and superman together
BRgCb1QjOv4,@micwen101 i noticed that already

qgHHBYzgL-s,"Mary Reilly wasn’t well received when it came out. <br>It has a 26% on Rotten Tomatoes with the general consensus saying that it has its moments, but overall relies on boredom.<br>Julia Roberts was especially criticized for being miscast, her laughable Irish accent and zero chemistry with co-star John Malkovich (also doesn’t really help that allegedly Roberts and Malkovich didn’t get along during filming).<br><br>The film also received 2 Razzie nominations for Worst Actress (Julia Roberts) and Worst Director (Stephen Frears).<br>Both lost against Demi Moore and Andrew Bergman (respectively) for Striptease"
qgHHBYzgL-s,3 alternative endings were filmed. I&#39;ve been trying to find these.could you find these?
qgHHBYzgL-s,"Never like Julia Roberts,"
qgHHBYzgL-s,I love this movie.It’s very sensual
qgHHBYzgL-s,Julia Roberts’ accent sounds less Irish &amp; more American. Glenn Close’s accent was more convincing
qgHHBYzgL-s,I&#39;m amazed to see Glenn Close in yet another movie playing beside John Malkovich. Dangerous Liaisons was so great! And in this trailer... Can Glenn even be more Cruella than this? :D
qgHHBYzgL-s,I love this movie. Next to Dangerous Liaisons. Its one of his best movies ever.
qgHHBYzgL-s,"&quot;He&#39;s waiting for me to sleep, He&#39;s waiting to destroy. Whenever you&#39;re close to me, I feel him kicking at the door.&quot; - How poetic :P"

cR1Zvw5MmLs,"Awesome opening, draws one right in, this real, powerful attention grabber, along with featuring opening music that strikes the right beat at the right pace and whose techno pulse is hypnotic, and all of which serves to render one mesmerized.  Great stuff👍👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧"
cR1Zvw5MmLs,such a shit film
cR1Zvw5MmLs,Can eny one tell me what year this film come out please
cR1Zvw5MmLs,"The opening, with the refinery and the Sabres&#39; of Paradise track: &#39;The Theme&#39; has resonated with me for years. One of the best openings of a film ever for me. Nice film too, I always thought it was underrated. Jude Law is excellent as a young actor."
cR1Zvw5MmLs,Ahhhhh! I can&#39;t believe this was filmed near my place! AHHHHH!
cR1Zvw5MmLs,I loved this movie when I was a teenager back in the 1990s
cR1Zvw5MmLs,where&#39;s part 2 and 3 so on and so on
cR1Zvw5MmLs,"B,M,W,...better make way!!!"
cR1Zvw5MmLs,The only car missing is the mighty ford escort rs cosworth.
cR1Zvw5MmLs,I used to love this film years ago. Watching it now its pretty shit
cR1Zvw5MmLs,"@cyberneticchaos, Opening song is, The Sabres of Paradise - Theme"
cR1Zvw5MmLs,Thanks for posting! :)
cR1Zvw5MmLs,"As a Young BoyRacer back in the late 1990&#39;s I loved this movie! Thanks for posting it!
&quot;Lets do Crime!&quot;"
cR1Zvw5MmLs,"i based my life of this movie
"
cR1Zvw5MmLs,"Favorite quote, two gti&#39;s an xr2, a midnight racer a black cosworth an rs turbo, theres some muscle here tonight.

Some funny scenes where sean pertwee who plays &#39;&#39;tommy&#39;&#39; is spinning round hitting for concrete posts with a bat shouting billy where the F*** are you..."
OlCO01s1upA,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23treeringsmixtape"">#TreeRingsMixtape</a> EP"
OlCO01s1upA,Superb drama-solid cast and rather underrated-see it!
OlCO01s1upA,- Love Al Pacino in these type of movies.  Great actor.
OlCO01s1upA,Good movie<br>
hspUSez-rYY,I hate that this trailer was not narrated by Alec Baldwin
hspUSez-rYY,still trying to find the bottle rocket in the film
hspUSez-rYY,No actual bottle rockets were harmed in the making of BOTTLE ROCKET.  Wes didn&#39;t know what they were.
hspUSez-rYY,Que terrible película. Terrible.
hspUSez-rYY,"When I first saw Owen Wilson, I thought it was a blonde Trent Reznor, I flipped out. Anyway, this movie reminds me of some nerd burglars I knew in high school."
hspUSez-rYY,💘
hspUSez-rYY,I bet that grand piano&#39;s worth ten grand.
hspUSez-rYY,Vincent Vega??
hspUSez-rYY,that nose of owen wilson wasn&#39;t that big yet in the nighties
hspUSez-rYY,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspUSez-rYY&amp;t=0m37s"">0:37</a> Jimmy Fallon is great in this movie"
hspUSez-rYY,this trailer is so bad but this movie is so good weird !!!!!
hspUSez-rYY,This trailer makes me think it sucks...
hspUSez-rYY,"Movie that looks to kick some ass, yes. Intelligent vision of &quot;Breaking &amp; Entering&quot; genre !"
hspUSez-rYY,Saw it back in the 90’s. I loved it. Started a long love affair watching the Wilson bros on film. The one that stays out of the light is hot too’
hspUSez-rYY,the first and only wes anderson  film i dindt like  i dont know whats about this movie make a cult film it was boring af
hspUSez-rYY,"Watching all the Wes Anderson movies, this looks soooo different from the aesthetic he later set in stone."
hspUSez-rYY,Can’t wait for Isle of Dogs.
hspUSez-rYY,This movie is amazing! This trailer is a huge disservice.
hspUSez-rYY,Trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice.
hspUSez-rYY,Missing is Ca-caw! Ca-caw!
hspUSez-rYY,adam the woo just stayed at that motel in the same room too
hspUSez-rYY,this trailer does not do the movie justice at all.
hspUSez-rYY,Box office flop... but in the top ten of Martin Scorsese&#39;s favorite movies.
hspUSez-rYY,"Such a great movie,just ordered the Criterion dvd,cant wait to watch it again!"
hspUSez-rYY,Loved the movie but I hate the trailer
hspUSez-rYY,Greg Gutfeld brought me here
hspUSez-rYY,"Saw this on opening weekend in the theater. There were about 5 other people in the auditorium, and it lost a lot of money. Made me really sad because I felt like I had discovered something amazing and the world wasn&#39;t paying attention. Fortunately I was wrong! It just took a few more years for the world to notice. One of my favorite films."
hspUSez-rYY,Such a great movie.
hspUSez-rYY,"Just saw it last night and can&#39;t stop thinking about it. I love this movie, its truly one of my cult movies now."
hspUSez-rYY,Thanks for providing the trailer!! Awesome movie!! see you guys! ;)
hspUSez-rYY,There are some scenes Iin this trailer which I haven&#39;y seen while watching a movie. How come?
hspUSez-rYY,"What&#39;s the song at the start with the brass at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspUSez-rYY&amp;t=0m06s"">0:06</a>? Also what&#39;s the blues song at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspUSez-rYY&amp;t=0m36s"">0:36</a>?"
hspUSez-rYY,"&quot;And my name&#39;s Dinan, man!&quot; That right there is enough for me wo wanna watch it!"
hspUSez-rYY,This is such a great movie
hspUSez-rYY,"Still have yet to see this one and Steve Zissou. LOVE Anderson&#39;s other stuff though. Moonrise Kingdom should&#39;ve received a lot more nominations from the Academy last year (including Best Picture). Oh well, their loss."
hspUSez-rYY,"I remember hearing the radio commercials for Bottle Rocket when it was first released. I was in high school, and doing office work for spare change. A couple years later I saw it at the local video store and I&#39;ve watched it every six months since. I&#39;ve never felt a stronger connection to any other movie.  "
hspUSez-rYY,one of those movies where the trailer just can&#39;t even begin to portray it with justice
hspUSez-rYY,"Holy crap , never saw O like that with his hair in that hair cut , looks different
"
hspUSez-rYY,i had too high of expectations. its an amazing film but anderson has def toned his directorial authorship (style?) a LOT. rushmore could almost has a different director. (great metaphot though)
hspUSez-rYY,"No awkward is a good thing. The movies have a style of their own. I think infoandexpression was just trying to give a compliment sageyprincess, thats all."
hspUSez-rYY,I don&#39;t know why everyone says that Wes Anderson films are awkward. They&#39;re not. All of Wes&#39; characters are well developed. not even a bit awkward
hspUSez-rYY,BEst comedy of ALL. TIME.
hspUSez-rYY,The Wilson&#39;s!
hspUSez-rYY,I will rocket you to the sky!
hspUSez-rYY,@eurydiceissonice That part wasn&#39;t in the movie either.
hspUSez-rYY,"Wes Anderson&#39;s best offering. Hell, the same could be said for the Wilson Bros; that includes Future Man."
hspUSez-rYY,"@k166a not true, hav u seen the royal tenebaums"
hspUSez-rYY,"@lacey72 Damn, ofcourse it&#39;s &quot;Jack The Ripper&quot;, I&#39;m embarrassed! Coolest guitar ever! Thank you!"
hspUSez-rYY,What&#39;s that cool surf/R&amp;B song playing at the end?
hspUSez-rYY,Luke Wilson is the same character in every movie...
hspUSez-rYY,could someone upload this full movie on youtube plz. i saw it on cable &amp; i just wanna watch it again. cause i enjoy it &amp; it was so funny.
